# BOOK COVER {-}

![An image of the book cover. It includes four quadrants of non-normal distributions representing gender, race/ethnicty, sustainability/global concerns, and journal articles](images/ReC_multivariate_bkcvr.png)

# PREFACE {-}

**If you are viewing this document, you should know that this is a book-in-progress.  Early drafts are released for the purpose teaching my classes and gaining formative feedback from a host of stakeholders.  The document was last updated on `r format (Sys.Date(), '%d %b %Y')`**

[Screencasted Lecture Link]

To *center* a variable in regression means to set its value at zero and interpret all other values in relation to this reference point. Regarding race and gender, researchers often center male and White at zero. Further, it is typical that research vignettes in statistics textbooks are similarly seated in a White, Western (frequently U.S.), heteronormative, framework. The purpose of this project is to create a set of open educational resources (OER) appropriate for doctoral and post-doctoral training that contribute to a socially responsive pedagogy -- that is, it contributes to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. 

Statistics training in doctoral programs are frequently taught with fee-for-use programs (e.g., SPSS/AMOS, SAS, MPlus) that may not be readily available to the post-doctoral professional. In recent years, there has been an increase and improvement in R packages (e.g., *psych*, *lavaan*) used for in analyses common to psychological research. Correspondingly, many graduate programs are transitioning to statistics training in R (free and open source).  This is a challenge for post-doctoral psychologists who were trained with other software. This OER will offer statistics training with R and be freely available (specifically in a GitHub respository and posted through GitHub Pages) under a Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike license [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0]. 

Training models for doctoral programs in HSP are commonly scholar-practitioner, scientist-practitioner, or clinical-scientist.  An emerging model, the *scientist-practitioner-advocacy* training model incorporates social justice advocacy so that graduates are equipped to recognize and address the sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities [@mallinckrodt_scientist-practitioner-advocate_2014]. In statistics textbooks, the use of research vignettes engages the learner around a tangible scenario for identifying independent variables, dependent variables, covariates, and potential mechanisms of change. Many students recall examples in Field's  [-@field_discovering_2012] popular statistics text:  Viagra to teach one-way ANOVA, beer goggles for two-way ANOVA, and bushtucker for repeated measures.  What if the research vignettes were more socially responsive? 

In this OER, research vignettes will be from recently published articles where: 

* the author’s identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, emerging nations), 
* the research has a JEDI/social responsivity focus, 
* the lesson’s statistic is used in the article, and 
* there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or it is publically available.  

In training for multicultural competence, the saying, "A fish doesn't know that it's wet" is often used to convey the notion that we are often unaware of our own cultural characteristics. In recent months and years, there has been an increased awakening to the institutional and systemic racism that our sytems are perpetuating. Queuing from the water metaphor, I am hopeful that a text that is recentered in the ways I have described can contribute to *changing the water* in higher education and in the profession of psychology.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS {-}

As a doctoral student at the University of Kansas (1992-2005), I learned that I "a foreign language" was required for graduation. *Please note that as one who studies the intersections of global, vocational, and sustainable psychology, I regret that I do not have language skills.* This could have been met with credit from high school -- but having grown up in rural, mid-Missouri -- my high school was exempt from this requiremnt. This requirement would have typically been met with a foreign language taken during an undergraduate program -- but my non-teaching degree at the University of Missouri's School of Education did not require one. The requirement could have also been met with a computer language (fortran, C++) -- I did not have any of those either. There was a tiny note on the degree plan that said that a 2-credit course, "SPSS for Windows" would also count.  Given that it was taught by my one of my favorite professors, I readily signed up. As it turns out, Samuel B. Green, PhD, was using the course to draft chapters in the textbook [@green_using_2014] that has been so helpful for so many. Unfortunately, Drs. Green (1947 - 2018) and Salkind (2947 - 2017) are no longer with us. I have worn out numerous versions of their text. Another favorite text of mine was Dr. Barbara Byrne's [-@byrne_structural_2016] text for learning SEM with AMOS. I had taken my tea-stained text with me to a workshop she taught at APA and was proud of the signature she added to it (a little catfur might have fallen out).  Dr. Byrne created SEM texts for a number of statistical programs (e.g., LISREL, EQS, MPlus). As I was learning R, I wrote Dr. Byrne and asked if she had one for SEM/CFA in R that I missed. She promptly wrote back, saying that she did not have the bandwidth to learn a new program.  We lost Dr. Byrne in December 2020. I am so grateful to these authors for their persistent, accessible, work. As my role models, I am aspiring to create something that is equally helpful. I am also grateful for the doctoral students who have taken my courses and are continuing to provide input for how to improve the materials.

At very practical levels, I am indebted to SPU's Library, and more specifically, SPU's Education, Technology, and Media Department.  Assistant Dean for Instructional Design and Emerging Technologies, R. John Robertson, MSc, MCS, has offered unlimited consultation, support, and connection. Senior Instructional Designer in Graphics & Illustrations,Dominic Wilkinson, designed the logo and bookcover.  Psychology and Scholarly Communications Librarian, Kristin Hoffman, MLIS, has provided consultation on topics ranging from OERS to citations. I am alo indebted to Associate Vice President, Teaching and Learning at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Rajiv Jhangiani, PhD. Dr. Jhangiani's text [-@jhangiani_research_2019] was the first OER I ever used and I was grateful for his encouraging conversation.

Financial support for this text has been provided from the *Call to Action on Equity, Inclusion, Diversity, Justice, and Social Responsivity
Request for Proposals* grant from the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (2021-2022).

# Introduction {#ReCintro}

[Screencasted Lecture Link]

## What to expect in each chapter

This textbook is intended as *applied,* in that a primary goal is to help the scientist-practitioner-advocate use a variety of statistics in research problems and *writing them up* for a program evaluation, dissertation, or journal article. In support of that goal, I try to provide just enough conceptual information so that the researcher can select the appropriate statistic (i.e., distinguishing between when ANOVA is appropriate and when regression is appropriate) and assign variables to their proper role (e.g., covariate, moderator, mediator).

This conceptual approach does include occasional, step-by-step, *hand-calculations* (only we calculate them arithmetically in R) to provide a *visceral feeling* of what is happening within the statistical algorithm that may be invisible to the researcher.  Additionally, the conceptual review includes a review of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data and research design that are required for the statistic. Statistics can be daunting, so I have worked hard to establish a *workflow* through each analysis. When possible, I include a flowchart that is referenced frequently in each chapter and assists the the researcher keep track of their place in the many steps and choices that accompany even the simplest of analyses.

As with many statistics texts, each chapter includes a *research vignette.* Somewhat unique to this resource is that the vignettes are selected from recently published articles. Each vignette is chosen with the intent to meet as many of the following criteria as possible:

* the statistic that is the focus of the chapter was properly used in the article,
* the author’s identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, emerging nations),
* the research has a justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, and social responsivity focus and will contribute positively to a social justice pedagogy, and 
* the data is available in a repository or there is sufficient  information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s).  

In each chapter we employ *R* packages that will efficiently calculate the statistic and the dashboard of metrics (e.g., effect sizes, confidence intervals) that are typically reported in psychological science.

## Strategies for Accessing and Using this OER

There are a number of ways you can access this resource. You may wish to try several strategies and then select which works best for you.  I demonstrate these in the screencast that accompanies this chapter.

1. Simply follow along in the .html formatted document that is available on via GitHug Pages, and then
   * open a fresh .rmd file of your own, copying (or retyping) the script  and running it 
2. Locate the original documents at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling) . You can
   * open them to simply take note of the "behind the scenes" script
   * copy/download individual documents that are of interest to you
   * fork a copy of the entire project to your own GitHub site and further download it (in its entirety) to your personal workspace. The [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) makes this easy!
3. Listen to the accompanying lectures (I think sound best when the speed is 1.75). The lectures are being recorded in Panopto and should include the closed captioning.
4. Provide feedback to me!  If you fork a copy to your own GitHub repository, you can 
   * open up an editing tool and mark up the document with your edits,
   * start a discussion by leaving comments/questions, and then
   * sending them back to me by committing and saving.  I get an e-mail notiying me of this action.  I can then review (accepting or rejecting) them and, if a discussion is appropriate, reply back to you.

## If You are New to R

R can be oveRwhelming. Jumping right into advanced statistics might not be the easiest way to start. However, in these chapters, I provide complete code for every step of the process, starting with uploading the data. To help explain what R script is doing, I sometimes write it in the chapter text; sometimes leave hastagged-comments in the chunks; and, particularly in the accompanying screencasted lectures, try to take time to narrate what the R script is doing.  

I've found that, somewhere on the internet, there's almost always a solution to what I'm trying to do. I am frequently stuck and stumped and have spent hours searching the internet for even the tiniest of things.  When you watch my videos, you may notice that in my R studio, there is a "scRiptuRe" file. I takes notes on the solutions and scripts here -- using keywords that are meaningful to me so that when I need to repeat the task, I can hopefully search my own prior solutions and find a fix or a hint.

### Base R

The base program is free and is available here:  https://www.r-project.org/  

Because R is already on my machine (and because the instructions are sufficient), I will not walk through the instllation, but I will point out a few things.

* Follow the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux)
* The "cran" (I think "cranium") is the *Comprehensive R Archive Network.*  In order for R to run on your computer, you have to choose a location.  Because proximity is somewhat related to processing speed, select one that is geographically "close to you." 
* You will see the results of this download on your desktop (or elsewhere if you chose to not have it appear there) but you won't ever use R through this platform.

### R Studio

*R Studio* is the desktop application I work in R.  It's a separate download. Choose the free, desktop, option that is appropriate for your operating system:   https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/

* Upper right window:  Includes several tabs; we frequently monitor the
  + Environment: it lists the *objects* that are available to you (e.g., dataframes)
* Lower right window: has a number of helpful tabs.
  + Files:  Displays the file structure in your computer's environment.  Make it a practice to (a) organize your work in small folders and (b) navigating to that small folder that is holding your project when you are working on it.
  + Packages:  Lists the packages that have been installed.  If you navigate to it, you can see if it is "on."  You can also access information about the package (e.g., available functions, examples of script used with the package) in this menu.  This information opens in the Help window.
  + Viewer and Plots are helpful, later, when we can simultaneously look at our output and still work on our script.
* Primary window
  + R Studio runs in the background(in the console).  Very occasionally, I can find useful troubleshooting information here.
  + More commonly, I open my R Markdown document so that it takes the whole screen and I work directly, right here.
* *R Markdown* is the way that many analysts write *script*, conduct analyses, and even write up results.  These are saved as .rmd files.
  + In R Studio, open an R Markdown document through File/New File/R Markdown
  + Specify the details of your document (title, author, desired ouput)
  + In a separate step, SAVE this document (File/Save] into a NEW FILE FOLDER that will contain anything else you need for your project (e.g., the data).
  + *Packages* are at the heart of working in R.  Installing and activating packages require writing script.

### R Hygiene

Many initial problems in R can be solved with good R hygiene. Here are some suggestions for basic practices.  It can be tempting to "skip this."  However, in the first few weeks of class, these are the solutions I am presenting to my students.

#### Everything is documented in the .rmd file

Although others do it differently, everything is in my .rmd file. That is, for uploading data and opening packages I write the code in my .rmd file.  Why?  Because when I read about what I did hours or years later, I have a permanent record of very critical things like (a) where my data is located, (b) what version I was using, and (c) what package was associated with the functions.

#### File organization

File organization is a critical key to this:

* Create a project file folder.
* Put the data file in it.
* Open an R Markdown file.
* Save it in the same file folder.
* When your data and .rmd files are in the same folder (not your desktop, but a shared folder), they can be connected.

#### Chunks

The R Markdown document is an incredible tool for integrating text, tables, and analyses.  This entire OER is written in R Markdown.  A central feature of this is "chunks."

The easiest way to insert a chunk is to use the INSERT/R command at the top of this editor box.  You can also insert a chunk with the keyboard shortcut:  CTRL/ALT/i

"Chunks" start and end with with those three tic marks and will show up in a shaded box, like this:

```{r title for the chunk contents}
#hashtags let me write comments to remind myself what I did
#here I am simply demonstrating arithmetic (but I would normally be running code)
2021 - 1966
```

Each chunk must open and close.  If one or more of your tic marks get deleted, your chunk won't be read as such and your script will not run.  The only thing in the chunks should be script for running R; you can hashtag-out script so it won't run.

Although unnecessary, you can add a brief title for the chunk in the opening row, after the "r."  These create something of a table of contents of all the chunks -- making it easier to find what you did.  You can access them in the "Chunks" tab at the bottom left of R Studio. If you wish to knit a document, you cannot have identical chunk titles.

You can put almost anything you want in the space outside of tics.  Syntax for simple formatting in the text areas (e.g,. using italics, making headings, bold, etc.) is found here:  https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html


#### Packages

As scientist-practitioners (and not coders), we will rely on *packages* to do our work for us. At first you may feel overwhelmed about the large number of packages that are available. Soon, though, you will become accustomed to the ones most applicable to our work (e.g., psych, tidyverse, lavaan, apaTables).

Researchers treat packages differently. In these lectures, I list all the packages we will use in an opening chunk that asks R to check to see if the package is installed, and if not, installs it.  

```{r checking for packages}
if(!require(psych)){install.packages("psych")}
```

To make a package operable, you need to open it through the library.  This process must be repeated each time you restart R. I don't open the package (through the "library(package_name)") command until it is time to use it.  Especially for new users, I think it's important to connect the functions with the specific packages.

```{r opening psych, package, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages ("psych")
library (psych)
```

If you type in your own "install.packages" code, hashtag it out once it's been installed.  It is problematic to continue to re-run this code .

#### Knitting

An incredible feature of R Markdown is its capacity to *knit* to HTML, powerpoint, or word. If you access the .rmd files for this OER, you can use annotate or revise them to suit your purposes.  If you redistribute them, though, please honor the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License with a citation.

### tRoubleshooting in R maRkdown

Hiccups are normal.  Here are some ideas that I have found useful in getting unstuck.

* In an R script, you must have everything in order -- Every. Single. Time. 
  + All the packages have to be in your library and activated; if you restart R, you need to reload each package.
  + If you open an .rmd file and want a boxplot, you cannot just scroll down to that script.  You need to run any *prerequisite* script (like loading the package, importing data, putting the data in the global environment, etc.)
  + Do you feel lost?  clear your global environment (broom) and start at the top of the R script. Frequent, fresh starts are good.
* Your .rmd file and your data need to be stored in the same file folder.  These should be separate for separate projects, no matter how small.
* Type any warnings you get into a search engine.  Odds are, you'll get some decent hints in a manner of seconds.  Especially at first, these are common errors:
  + The package isn't loaded (if you restarted R, you need to reload your packages)
  + The .rmd file has been saved yet, or isn't saved in the same folder as the data
  + Errors of punctuation or spelling
* Restart R (it's quick -- not like restarting your computer)
* If you receive an error indicating that a function isn't working or recognized, and you have loaded the package, type the name of the package in front of the function with two colons (e.g., psych::describe(df). If multiple packages are loaded with functions that have the same name, R can get confused.

### stRategies for success

* Engage with R, but don't let it overwhelm you.
  + The *mechanical is also the conceptual*. Especially when it is *simpler*, do try to retype the script into your own .rmd file and run it. Track down the errors you are making and fix them.
  + If this stresses you out, move to simply copying the code into the .rmd file and running it.  If you continue to have errors, you may have violated one of the best practices above (Is the package loaded? Are the data and .rmd files in the same place? Is all the prerequisite script run?).
  + Still overwhelmed?  Keep moving forward by downloading a copy of the .rmd file that accompanies any given chapter and just "run it along" with the lecture. Spend your mental power trying to understand what each piece does. Then select a practice problem that is appropriate for your next level of growth. 
* Copy script that works elsewhere and replace it with your datafile, variables, etc.  
* The leaRning curve is steep, but not impossible.  Gladwell[-@gladwell_outliers_2008] reminds us that it takes about 10,000 hours to get GREAT at something (2,000 to get reasonably competent). Practice. Practice. Practice.
* Updates to R, R Studio, and the packages are NECESSARY, but can also be problematic.  It could very well be that updates cause programs/script to fail (e.g., "X has been deprecated for version X.XX").  Moreover, this very well could have happened between my distribution of these resources and your attempt to use it.  My personal practice is to update R, R Studio, and the packages a week or two before each academic term.
* Embrace your downward dog.  Also, walk away, then come back.

# DATA PREP {-#dataprep}
# Scrubbing {#scrub}

[Screencasted Lecture Link](https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?pid=7c87f991-276b-448f-aed9-acf6015b9638) 

The focus of this chapter is the process of starting with raw data and preparing it for multivariate analysis.   To that end, we will address the conceptual considerations and practical steps in "scrubbing and scoring." 

A twist in this lesson is that we are asking you to contribute to the dataset that serves as the basis for the chapter and the practice problems. In the spirit of *open science*, this dataset is available to you and others for your own learning. Before continuing, please take 15-20 minutes to complete the survey titled, [Rate-a-Recent-Course:  A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise](https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU). The study is approved by the Institutional Review Board at Seattle Pacific University (SPUIRB# 202102011, no expiration). Details about the study, including an informed consent, are included at the link.

## Navigating this Lesson

There is about 90 minutes of lecture.  If you work through the materials with me it would be good to add another hour.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail.  All original materials are provided at the [Github site](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling) that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's [introduction](#ReCintro)

### Learning Objectives

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

* Import data from Qualtrics into R.
* Begin the scrubbing process by applying exclusion and inclusion criteria. 
* Rename variables.
* Create a smaller dataframe with variables appropriate for testing a specific statistical model.
* Use critical data manipulation functions from the *tidyverse* (and *dplyr*) in particular such as *filter()*, *select()*, and *mutate()* to prepare variables.
* Articulate the initial steps in a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.

### Planning for Practice

<!-- TODO: Specify set of items to score for homework. -->

The suggestions for practice will start with this chapter and continue in the next two chapters (Scoring, Data Dx). Using Parent's [-@parent_handling_2013] AIA approach to managing missing data, you will scrub-and-score a raw dataset. Options of graded complexity could incude:

* Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written.
* Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose.
* Begin with raw data to which you have access. 

### Readings & Resources

In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s). Other resources are cited (when possible, linked) in the text with complete citations in the reference list.

### Packages

The script below will (a) check to see if the following packages are installed on your computer and, if not (b) install them.

<!-- TODO: Build out this section. -->
```{r initial packages 02, eval=FALSE}
#will install the package if not already installed
if(!require(qualtRics)){install.packages("qualtRics")}
if(!require(tidyverse)){install.packages("tidyverse")}
```


## Workflow for Scrubbing and Scoring

The following is a proposed workflow for preparing data for analysis. 

<!-- TODO: When finalized, save as PDF so it can open in its own window) -->

![An image of a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.](images/Ch02/scrubscore_wrkflow.jpg) 

Here is a narration of the figure:

1. The workflow begins by importing data into R. Most lessons in this series involve simulated data that are created directly in R. Alternatively, data could be:
   * imported "intRavenously" through programs such as Qualtrics,
   * exported from programs such as Qualtrics to another program (e.g., .xlxs, .csv)
   * imported in other forms (e.g., .csv,.sps, .sav).
2. Scrubbing data by 
   * variable naming,
   * specifying variable characteristics such as factoring,
   * ensuring that included particpiants consented to participation, 
   * determining and executing the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
3. Conduct preliminary data diagnostics such as
   * outlier anlaysis
   * assessing for univariate and multivariate analysis
   * making transformations and/or corrections
4. Managing missingness by one of two routes
   * Available information analysis [@parent_handling_2013] at either the item-level or scale level.  The result is a single set of data for analysis.  If missingness remains, options include pairwise deletion, listwise deletion, or specifying FIML (when available).  Another option is to use multiple imputation.
   * Multiple imputation at either scale level or item-level

To provide first-hand experience as both the respondent and analyst for the same set of data, you were asked to complete a survey titled, [Rate-a-Recent-Course:  A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise](https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU).  If you haven't yet completed it, please consider doing so, now. In order to reduce the potential threats to validity by providing background information about the survey, I will wait to describe it until later in the chapter.

The survey is administered in Qualtrics. In the chapter I teach two ways to import Qualtrics data into R. We will then use the data to work through the steps identified in the workflow.

## Working the Problem

### intRavenous Qualtrics

I will demonstrate using a Qualtrics account at my institution, Seattle Pacific University. The only surveys in this account are for the *Recentering Psych Stats* chapters and lessons. All surveys are designed to not capture personally identifying information.

Access credentials for the institutional account, individual user's account, and survey are essential for getting the survey items and/or results to export into R. The Qualtrics website provides a tutorial for [generating an API token](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/integrations/api-integration/overview/#GeneratingAnAPIToken).     

We need two pieces of information:  the **root_url** and an **API token**.  

* Log into your respective qualtrics.com account.
* Select Account Settings
* Choose "Qualtrics IDs" from the user name dropdown

We need the  **root_url**.  This is the first part of the web address for the Qualtrics account.  For our institution it is: spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com 

The API token is in the box labeled, "API." If it is empty, select, "Generate Token." If you do not have this option, locate the *brand administrator* for your Qualtrics account. They will need to set up your account so that you have API privileges.

*BE CAREFUL WITH THE API TOKEN*  This is the key to your Qualtrics accounts.  If you leave it in an .rmd file that you forward to someone else, this key and the base URL gives access to every survey in your account. If you share it, you could be releasing survey data to others that would violate confidentiality promises in an IRB application.

If you mistakenly give out your API token you can generate a new one within your Qualtrics account and re-protect all its contents.

You do need to change the API key/token if you want to download data from a different Qualtrics account.  If your list of surveys generates the wrong set of surveys, restart R, make sure you have the correct API token and try again.

```{r API token, eval=FALSE}
#only have to run this ONCE to draw from the same Qualtrics account...but will need to get different token if you are changing between accounts 
library(qualtRics)
#qualtrics_api_credentials(api_key = "mUgPMySYkiWpMFkwHale1QE5HNmh5LRUaA8d9PDg",
              #base_url = "spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com", overwrite = TRUE, install = TRUE)
```

*all_surveys()* generates a dataframe containing information about all the surveys stored on your Qualtrics account.

```{r Show all surveys, eval=FALSE}
surveys <- all_surveys() 
#View this as an object (found in the right: Environment).  
#Get survey id # for the next command
#If this is showing you the WRONG list of surveys, you are pulling from the wrong Qualtrics account (i.e., maybe this one instead of your own). Go back and change your API token (it saves your old one). Changing the API likely requires a restart of R.
surveys
```

To retrieve the survey, use the *fetch_survey()* function.  

```{r intRavenous Qualtrics,  message=FALSE, WARNING=FALSE}
#obtained with the survey ID 
#"surveyID" should be the ID from above
#"verbose" prints messages to the R console
#"label", when TRUE, imports data as text responses; if FALSE prints the data as numerical responses
#"convert", when TRUE, attempts to convert certain question types to the "proper" data type in R; because I don't like guessing, I want to set up my own factors.
#"force_request", when TRUE, always downloads the survey from the API instead of from a temporary directory (i.e., it always goes to the primary source)
# "import_id", when TRUE includes the unique Qualtrics-assigned ID; since I have provided labels, I want false

#Out of the blue, I started getting an error, that R couldn't find function "fetch_survey."  After trying a million things, adding qualtRics:: to the front of it solved the problem
QTRX_df <-qualtRics::fetch_survey(surveyID = "SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU", time_zone = NULL, verbose = FALSE, label=FALSE, convert=FALSE, force_request = TRUE, import_id = FALSE)

#useLocalTime = TRUE,
```

### About the *Rate-a-Recent-Course* Survey

<!-- TODO: Add link to chapter when it is available. -->

As a teaching activity for the ReCentering Psych Stats OER, the topic of the survey was selected to be consistent with the overall theme of OER. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to understand the campus climate for students whose identities make them vulnerable to bias and discrimination. These include  students who are Black, non-Black students of color, LGBTQ+ students, international students, and students with disabilities. 

Although the dataset should provide the opportunity to test a number of statistical models, one working hypothesis that framed the study is that the there will be a greater sense of belonging and less bias and discrimination when there is similar representation (of identities that are often marginalized) in the instructional faculty and student body. Termed,  "structural diversity" [@lewis_black_2019] this is likely an oversimplification.  In fact, an increase in diverse representation without attention to interacting factors can increase hostility on campus [@hurtado_linking_2007]. Thus, we included the task of rating of a single course relates to the larger campus along the dimensions of belonging and bias/discrimination. For example, if a single class has higher ratings on issues of inclusivity, diversity, and respect, we would expect that sentiment to be echoed in the broader institution.

Our design has notable limitations  You will likely notice that we ask about demographic characteristics of the instructional staff and classmates in the course rated, but we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent. In making this decision, we likely lose important information; Iacovino and James [-@iacovino_retaining_2016] have noted that White students perceive campus more favorably than Black student counterparts. We made this decision to protect the identity of the respondent. As you will see when we download the data, if a faculty member asked an entire class to take the survey, the datestamp and a handful of demographic identifiers could very likely identify a student. In certain circumstances, this might be risky in that private information (i.e., gender nonconformity, disclosure of a disability) or course evaluation data could be related back to the student.  

Further, the items that ask respondents to *guess* the identities of the instructional staff and classmates are limited, and contrary to best practices in survey construction that recommend providing the option of a "write-in" a response.  After consulting with a diverse group of stakeholders and subject matter experts (and revising the response options numerous times) I have attempted to center anti-Black racism in the U.S. [@mosley_critical_2021; @mosley_radical_2020; @singh_building_2020].  In fact, the display logic does not present the race items when the course is offered outside the U.S. There are only five options for race: *biracial/multiracial*, *Black*, *non-Black person(s) of color*, *White*, and *I did not notice* (intended to capture a color-blind response). One unintended negative consequence of this design is that the response options could contribute to *colorism* [@adames_fallacy_2021; @capielo_rosario_acculturation_2019]. Another possibility is that the limited options may erase, or make invisible, other identities. At the time that I am writing the first draft of this chapter, the murder of six Asian American women in Atlanta has just occurred. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremeism has documented that while overall hate drimes dropped by 7% in 2020, anti-Asian hate crimes reported to the police in America's largest cities increasedby 149% [@noauthor_fact_nodate]. These incidents have occurred not only in cities, but in our neighborhoods and on our campusus [@kim_guest_2021; @kim_yes_2021; @noauthor_stop_nodate]. While this survey is intended to assess campus climate as a function of race, it unfortunately does not distinguish between many identities that experience marginalization. 

In parallel, the items asking respondents to identity characteristics of the instructional staff along dimensions of gender, international status, and disability are "large buckets" and do not include "write-in" options. Similarly, there was no intent to cause harm by erasing or making invisible individuals whose identities are better defined by different descriptors.  Further, no write-in items were allowed.  This was also intentional to prevent potential harm caused by people who could leave inappropriate or harmful comments. 


### The Codebook
In order to scrub-and-score a survey, it is critical to know about its content, scoring directions for scales/subscales, and its design. A more complete description of the survey design elements is (or will be) available in the *Recentering Psych Stats: Psychometric* OER. The review in this chapter provides just-enough information to allow us to make decisions about which items to retain and how to score them. When they are well-written, information in the [IRB application](./Bikos_ReCenteringPsychStats_ReCupload.pdf) and [pre-registration](https://osf.io/a8e5u) can be helpful in the scrubbing and scoring process.

Let's look "live" at the survey. In Qualtrics it is possible to *print* a PDF that looks very similar to its presentation when someone is taking it. You can access that static version [here](./Rate_a_CoursePDF.pdf).

We can export a [codebook](./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf), that is, a Word (or PDF) version of the survey with all the coding.  In Qualtrics the protocol is: Survey/Tools/ImportExport/Export Survey to Word.  Then select all the options you want (especially "Show Coded Values"). A tutorial provided by Qualtrics can be found [here](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/). This same process can be used to print the PDF example I used above.

It is almost impossible to give this lecture without some reference to Qualtrics and the features used in Qualtrics. An import of raw data from Qualtrics into R can be nightmare in that the Qualtrics-assigned variable names are numbers (e.g., QID1, QID2) – but often out of order because the number is assigned when the question is first created.  If the survey is reordered, the numbers get out of sequence.

Similarly, values for Likert-type scales can also get out of order if the scale anchors are revised (which is common to do).

I recommend providing custom variable names and recode values directly in Qualtrics before exporting them into R.  A Qualtrics tutorial for this is provided [here](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/question-options/recode-values/). In general, consider these qualities when creating variable names:

*	Brevity: historically, SPSS variable names could be a maximum of 8 characters.
*	Intuitive: although variables can be renamed in R (e.g., for use in charts and tables), it is helpful when the name imported from  Qualtrics provides some indication of what the variable is.
*	Systematic: start items in a scale with the same stem, followed by the item number -- ITEM1, ITEM2, ITEM3.

The Rate-a-Recent-Course survey was written using some special features in Qualtrics.  These include

* Display logic
  * Items that are U.S.-centric are only shown if the respondent is taking a course from an institution in the U.S. is a student in the U.S.
* Loop and merge
  * Because course may have multiple instructional staff, the information asking about demographic characteristics of the instructors is repeated according to the number input by the respondent
* Random presentation of the 30 items asking about campus climate for the five groups of students
  * Although this might increase the cognitive load of the survey, this helps "spread out" missingness for respondents who might tire of the survey and stop early
* Rank ordering of the institutional level (department, school/faculty, campus/university) to which the respondent feels most connected

Looking at the QTRX_df, *StartDate* thru *UserLanguage* are metadata created by Qualtrics. The remaining variables and associated value labels are in the [codebook](./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf).  


## Scrubbing

With a look at our survey, codebook, and imported data, we now get to the business of scRubbing (deleting those who did not give consent, deleting previews, etc.). This level of "scrubbing" precedes the more formal detection of outliers.

### Tools for Data Manipulations

The next stages will provide some experience manipulating data with **dplyr** from  the **tidyverse**.

The **tidyverse** is a system of packages (i.e,. when you download the tidyverse, you download all its packages/members) for data manipulation, exploration and visualization.  The packages in the tidyverse share a common design philosophy. These were mostly developed by Hadley Wickham, but more recently, more designers are contributing to them. Tidyverse packages are intended to make statisticians and data scientists more productive by guiding them through workflows that facilitate communication and result in reproducible work products. Fundamentally, the tidyverse is about the connections between the tools that make the workflow possible. Critical packages in the tidyverse include:

*  **dplyr**: data manipulation:  mutate, select, filter, summarize, arrange
*  **ggplot2**: extravagant graphing
*  **tibble**:  a *tibble* is a dataframe that provides the user with more (and less) control over the data.
*  **readr**: gives access to "rectangular data" like .csv and tables
*  **tidyr**: tidy data is where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, each value is a cell (duh).  **tidyr**'s contributions are gather(wide to long) and spread(long to wide) as well as separate, extract, unite.
*  **purrr**: facilitates working with functions and vectors. For example, if you write a function, using purrr may help you replace loops with code that is more efficient and intuitive.

The tidyverse is ever-evolving -- so check frequently for updates and troubleshooting.

A handy cheatsheet for data transformation is found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf).

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

For me, the first pass at scrubbing is to eliminate the obvious. In our case this is includes *previews* and respondents who did not consent to continue.  Previews are the researcher-initiated responses usually designed to proofread or troubleshoot survey problems. There could be other first-pass-deletions, such as selecting response between certain dates. 

I think these first-pass deletions, especially the ones around consent, are important to do as soon as possible. Otherwise, we might delete some of the variables (e.g., timestamps, consent documentation, preview status) and neglect to delete these cases later in the process.

We are here in the workflow:

![An image of a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.](images/Ch02/wrkflow_prelim.jpg)


We can either update the existing df (by using the same object), or creating a new df from the old. Either works. In my early years, I tended to create lots of new objects. As I have gained confidence in myself and in R, I'm inclined to update the existing df. Why? Because unless you write the object as an outfile (using the same name for the object as for the filename -- which I do not recommend), the object used in R does not change the source of the dat.  Therefore, it is easy to correct early code and it keeps the global environment less cluttered.

In this particular survey, the majority of respondents will take the survey because they clicked an *anonymous* link provided by Qualtrics.  Another Qualtrics distribution method is e-mail.  At the time of this writing, we have not recruited by e-mail, but it is is possible we could do so in the future.  What we should not include, though, are *previews*.  These are the times when the researcher is self-piloting the survey to look for errors and to troubleshoot. 

```{r exclude previews,  message=FALSE, WARNING=FALSE}
# the filter command is used when we are making inclusion/exclusion decisions about rows
# != means do not include cases with "preview"
library(tidyverse)
QTRX_df <- filter (QTRX_df, DistributionChannel != "preview")

#FYI, another way that doesn't use tidyverse, but gets the same result
#QTRX_df <- QTRX_df[!QTRX_df$DistributionChannel == "preview",]
```


APA Style, and in particular the Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) for quantitative research specify that we should report the frequency or percentages of missing data.  We would start our counting *after* eliminating the previews.  

```{r number of cases}
# I created an object that lists how many rows/cases remain.
# I used inline text below to update the text with the new number
attempts <- nrow(QTRX_df)
attempts
```

CAPTURING RESULTS FOR WRITING IT UP:  Data screening suggested that `r attempts` individuals opened the survey link.

Next let's filter in only those who consented to take the survey.  Because Qualtrics discontinued the survey for everyone who did not consent, we do not have to worry that their data is unintentionally included, but it can be useful to mention the number of non-consenters in the summary of missing data.
```{r include consented}
# == are used 
QTRX_df <-(filter (QTRX_df, Consent == 1))
consented_attempts <- nrow(QTRX_df)
consented_attempts
```
CAPTURING RESULTS FOR WRITING IT UP:  Data screening suggested that `r attempts` individuals opened the survey link. Of those, `r consented_attempts`, granted consent and proceeded into the survey items.

In this particular study, the categories used to collect race were U.S.-centric.  Thus, they were only shown if the respondent indicated that the course being rated was taught by an institution in the U.S. Therefore, an an additional inclusion criteria for this specific research model should be that the course was taught in the U.S.
```{r include US institutions}
QTRX_df <-(filter (QTRX_df, USinst == 0))
US_inclusion <- nrow(QTRX_df)
US_inclusion
```

CAPTURING RESULTS FOR WRITING IT UP:  Data screening suggested that `r attempts` individuals opened the survey link. Of those, `r consented_attempts`, granted consent and proceeded into the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; `r US_inclusion` met this criteria.

### Renaming Variables

Even though we renamed the variables in Qualtrics, the loop-and-merge variables were auto-renamed such that they each started with a number. I cannot see how to rename these from inside Qualtrics. A potential problem is that, in R, when variable names start with numbers, they need to be surrounded with single quotation marks. I find it easier to rename them now. I used "i" to start the variable name to represent "instructor."

The form of the *rename()* function is this:
df_named <- rename(df_raw, NewName1 = OldName1)

```{r rename variables that start with numbers}
library(tidyverse)
QTRX_df <- rename(QTRX_df, iRace1 = '1_iRace', iRace2 = '2_iRace', iRace3 = '3_iRace', iRace4 = '4_iRace', iRace5 = '5_iRace', iRace6 = '6_iRace', iRace7 = '7_iRace', iRace8 = '8_iRace', iRace9 = '9_iRace', iRace10 = '10_iRace')
```

Also in Qualtrics, it was not possible to rename the variable (formatted with sliders) that asked respondents to estimate the proportion of classmates in each race-based category.  Using the codebook, we can do this now.  I will use "cm" to precede each variable name to represent "classmates."
```{r rename a regular variable}
QTRX_df <- rename(QTRX_df, cmBiMulti = Race_10, cmBlack = Race_1, cmNBPoC = Race_7, cmWhite = Race_8, cmUnsure = Race_2)
```

Let's also create an ID variable (different from the lengthy Qualtrics-issued ID) and then move it to the front of the distribution.
```{r create ID variable}
QTRX_df <- QTRX_df %>% mutate(ID = row_number())

#moving the ID number to the first column; requires 
QTRX_df <- QTRX_df%>%select(ID, everything())
```

### Downsizing the Dataframe

Although researchers may differ in their approach, my tendency is to downsize the df to the variables I will be using in my study.  These could include variables in the model, demographic variables, and potentially auxiliary variables (i.e,. variables not in the model, but that might be used in the case of multiple imputation).  

This particular survey did not collect demographic information, so that will not be used.  The model that I will demonstrate in this research vignette examines the the respondent's perceived campus climate for students who are Black, predicted by the the respondent's own campus belonging, and also the *structural diversity* [@lewis_black_2019] proportions of Black students in the classroom and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) instructional staff. 

*I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the %Black instructional staff.  At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this.* 

The *select()* function can let us list the variables we want to retain.

```{r select model variables}
#You can use the ":" to include all variables from the first to last variable in any sequence; I could have written this more efficiently.  I just like to "see" my scales and clusters of variables.

Model_df <-(select (QTRX_df, ID, iRace1, iRace2, iRace3, iRace4, iRace5, iRace6, iRace7, iRace8, iRace9, iRace10, cmBiMulti, cmBlack, cmNBPoC, cmWhite, cmUnsure, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6))
```


It can be helpful to save outfile of progress as we go along.  Here I save this raw file.
```{r write outfile}
write.table(Model_df, file="BlackStntsModel210318.csv", sep=",", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)
```


## Toward the APA Style Write-up

### Method/Procedure

Data screening suggested that `r attempts` individuals opened the survey link. Of those, `r consented_attempts` granted consent and proceeded to the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; `r US_inclusion` met this criteria.


## Practice Problems

Starting with this chapter, the practice problems for this and the next two chapters (i.e., Scoring, Data Dx) are connected. Whatever practice option(s) you choose, please (a) use raw data that (b) has some data missing.  This second criteria will be important in the subsequent chapters.

The three problems below are listed in the order of graded complexity. If you are just getting started, you may wish to start with the first problem. If you are more confident, choose the second or third option. You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis.


### Problem #1: Rework the Chapter Problem

Because the *Rate-a-Recent-Course* survey remains open, it is quite likely that there will be more participants who have taken the survey since this chapter was last updated. If not -- please encourage a peer to take it.  Even one additional response will change the results. This practice problem encourages you to rework the chapter, as written, with the updated data from the survey.

### Problem #2:  Use the *Rate-a-Recent-Course* Survey, Choosing Different Variables

Before starting this option, choose a minimum of three variables from the *Rate-a-Recent-Course* survey to include in a simple statistical model. Work through the chapter making decisions that are consistent with the research model you have proposed. There will likely be differences at several points in the process.  For example, you may wish to include (not exclude) data where the rated-course was offered by an institution outside the U.S. Different decisions may involve an internet search for the R script you will need as you decide on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

### Problem #3:  Other data

Using raw data for which you have access, use the chapter as a rough guide.  Your data will likely have unique characteristics that may involved searching for solutions beyond this chapter/OER.

### Importing data from an exported Qualtrics .csv file

The lecture focused on the "intRavenous" import.  It is is also possible to download the Qualtrics data in a variety of formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, SPSS).  Since I got started using files with the CSV extension (think "Excel" lite), that is my preference.

In Qualtrics, these are the steps to download the data:  Projects/YOURsurvey/Data & Analysis/Export & Import/Export data/CSV/Use numeric values

I think that it is critical that to save this file in the same folder as the .rmd file that you will use with the data. 

R is sensitive to characters used filenames  As downloaded, my Qualtrics .csv file had a long name with spaces and symbols that are not allowed.  Therore, I gave it a simple, sensible, filename, "ReC_Download210319.csv".  An idiosyncracy of mine is to datestamp filenames. I use two-digit representations of the year, month, and date so that if the letters preceding the date are the same, the files would alphabetize automatically.

```{r Read a CSV file exported from Qualtrics}
library(qualtRics)
QTRX_csv <- read_survey("ReC_Download210319.csv", strip_html = TRUE, import_id = FALSE, time_zone=NULL, legacy = FALSE)
```

Although minor tweaking may be required, the same script above should be applicable to this version of the data.  

```{r sessionInfo 02}
sessionInfo()
```

# Scoring {#score}

[Screencasted Lecture Link](https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?pid=18a6be07-5bdc-404d-bc95-acf601830887)

The focus of this chapter is to continue the process of scrubbing-and-scoring.  We continue with the raw data we downloaded and prepared in the prior chapter. In this chapter we analyze and manage missingness, score scales/subscales, and represent our work with an APA-style write-up. To that end, we will address the conceptual considerations and practical steps in this process. 

## Navigating this Lesson

There is about 1 hour and 20 minutes of lecture.  If you work through the materials with me it would be good to add another hour.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail.  All original materials are provided at the [Github site](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling) that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's [introduction](#ReCintro)

### Learning Objectives

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

* Recognize the key components of data loss mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), including how to diagnose MCAR.
* Interpret missingness figures produced by packages such as *mice*.
* Articulate a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.
* Use critical data manipulation functions from *dplyr* including *filter()*, *select()*, and *mutate()* to prepare variables.
* Interpret code related to missingness (i.e., "is.na", "!is.na") and the pipe (%>%)

### Planning for Practice

<!-- TODO: Specify set of items to score for homework. -->

The suggestions for practice continue from the prior chapter. The assignment in the prior chapter involved downloading a dataset from Qualtrics and the "scrubbing" it on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using that same data, the practice suggestions in this chapter will continue to use Parent's [-@parent_handling_2013] AIA approach to managing missing data, to score the variables of interest. Options of graded complexity could incude:

* Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written.
* Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose.
* Begin with raw data to which you have access.

## Workflow for Scrubbing and Scoring

The following is a proposed workflow for preparing data for analysis. 

<!-- TODO: When finalized, save as PDF so it can open in its own window) -->

The same workflow guides us through the Scrubbing, Scoring, and Data dx chapters.  At this stage in the chapter we are still scrubbing as we work through the item-level and whole-level portions of the AIA (left side) of the chart.

## Research Vignette

The research vignette comes from the survey titled, [Rate-a-Recent-Course:  A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise](https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU) and is explained in the prior chapter. In the prior chapter we conducted super-preliminary scrubbing of variables that will allow us to examine the respondent's perceived campus climate for students who are Black, predicted by the the respondent's own campus belonging, and also the *structural diversity* proportions of Black students in the classroom and the  BIPOC instructional staff. At present, I see this as a parallel mediation. That is, the perceived campus climate for Black students will be predicted by the respondent's sense of belonging, through the proportion of Black classmates and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color)instructional staff.

*I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the %Black instructional staff.  At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this.* 

![An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data.](images/Ch03/BlStuMed.jpg)


First, though, let's take a more conceptual look at issues regarding missing data.  We'll come back to details of the survey as we work with it.

## On Missing Data

On the topic of missing data, we follow the traditions in most textbooks.  We start by considering *data loss mechanisms* and options for *managing missingness.*

Although the workflow I recommend is fairly straightforward, the topic is not.  Quantitative psychologist have produced volumes of research that supports and refutes all of these issues in detail.  An in-deth review of this is found in Enders' [-@enders_applied_2010] text.

### Data Loss Mechanisms

We generally classify missingess in data in three different ways [@kline_principles_2016; @parent_handling_2013]: 

**Missing completely at random (MCAR)** is the ideal case (and often unrealistic in actual data).  For variable *Y* this mean that

* Missingness is due to a factor(s) completely unrelated to the missing data.  Stated another way: 
  * Missing observations differ from the observed scores only by chance; that is, whether scores on Y are missing or not missing is unrelated to *Y* itself
* The presence versus absence of data on *Y* is unrelated to all other variables in the dataset.  That is, the nonmissing data are just a random sample of scores that the researcher would have analyzed had the data been complete.  We might think of it as *haphazard* missing.
  * A respondent is interrupted, looks up, looks down, and skips an item.
  * A computer glitch causes spotty missingness -- unrelated to any particular variable.
  
MCAR is the ideal state because results from it should not be biased as a function of the missingness.

**Missing at random (MAR)** missing data arise from a process that is both measured and predictable in a particular sample. *Admittedly the use of "random" in this term is odd, because, by definition, the missingness is not random.*

Restated:

1. Missingness on Y is unrelated to Y itself, but
2. Missingness is on Y is correlated with other variables in the data set.

Example: Men are less likely to respond to questions about mental health than women, but among men, the probability of responding is unrelated to their true mental health status.

Kline [-@kline_principles_2016] indicated that information loss due to MAR is potentially recoverable through imputation where missing scores are replaced by predicted scores.  The predicted scores are generated from other variables in the data set that predict missingness on Y.  If the strength of that prediction is reasonably strong, then results on Y after imputation may be relatively unbiased.  In this sense, the MAR pattern is described as *ignorable* with regard to potential bias. Two types of variables can be used to predict the missing data 

1.  variables that are in the prediction equation, and 
2. *auxiliary* variables (i.e., variables in the dataset that are not in the prediction equation).

Parent [-@parent_handling_2013] noted that multiple imputation and expectation maximization have frequently been used to manage missingness in MAR circumstances.

**Missing not at random (MNAR)** is when the presence versus absence of scores on *Y* depend on *Y* itself.  This is *non-ignorable*.

For example, if a patient drops out of a medical RCT because there are unpleasant side effects from the treatment, this discomfort is not measured, but the data is missing due to a process that is unknown in a particular data set.  Results based on *complete cases only* can be severely biased when the data loss pattern is MNAR.  That is, a treatment may look more beneficial than it really is if data from patients who were unable to tolerate the treatment are lost.

Parent [-@parent_handling_2013] described MNAR a little differently -- but emphasized that the systematic missingness would be related to a variable outside the datset. Parent provided the example of items written in a manner that may be inappropriate for some participants (e.g., asking women about a relationship with their boyfriend/husband, when the woman might be in same gender relationship).  If there were not demographic items that could identify the bias, this would be MNAR.  Parent strongly advises researchers to carefully proofread and pilot surveys to avoid MNAR circumstances.

Kline [-@kline_principles_2016] noted that the choice of the method to deal with the incomplete records can make a difference in the results, and should be made carefully.

### Diagnosing Missing Data Mechanisms

The bad news is that we never really know (with certainty) the type of missing data mechanism in our data. The following tools can help understand the mechanisms that contribute to missingness.

* Missing data analyses often includes correlations that could predict missingness.
* Little and Rubin [-@little_statistical_2002] proposed a multivariate statistical test of the MCAR assumption that simultaneously compares complete versus incomplete cases on *Y* across all other variables.  If this comparison is significant, then the MCAR hypothesis is rejected. 
  * To restate: we want a non-significant result; and we use the sometimes-backwards-sounding NHST (null hypothesis significance testing) language, "MCAR cannot be rejected."
* MCAR can also be examined through a series of *t* tests of the cases that have missing scores on Y with cases that have complete records on other variables. Unfortunately, sample sizes contribute to problems with interpretation.  With low samples, they are underpowered; in large samples they can flag trivial differences.

If MCAR is rejected, we are never sure whether the data loss mechanism is MAR or MNAR. There is no magical statistical "fix."  Kline [-@kline_principles_2016] wrote, "About the best that can be done is to understand the nature of the underlying data loss pattern and accordingly modify your interpretation of the results" (p. 85).

### Managing Missing Data

There are a number of approaches to managing missing data.  Here is a summary of the ones most commonly used.

* **Listwise deletion** (aka, Complete Case Analysis)  If there is a missing score on any variable, that case is excluded from **all**
analyses.
  
* **Pairwise deletion** Cases are excluded only if they have missing data on variables involved in a particular analysis. AIA is a variant of pair-wise deletion, but it preserves as much data as possible with person-mean imputation at the scale level.

* **Mean/median substitution** Mean/median substitution replaces missing values with the mean/median of that particular variable.  While this preserves the mean of the dataset, it can cause bias by decreasing variance.  For example, if you have a column that has substantial of missingness and you replace each value with the same, fixed, mean, the variability of that variable has just been reduced.  A variation on this is a **group-mean substitution** where the missing score in a particular group (e.g., women) is replaced by the group mean.

*  **Full information maximum likelihood (FIML)**  A *model-based method* that takes the researcher's model as the starting point.  The procedure partitions the cases in a raw data file into subsets, each with the same pattern of missing observations, including none (complete cases).  Statistical information (e.g., means, variances) is extracted from each subset so all case are retained in the analysis.  Parameters for the researcher's model are estimated after combining all available information over the subsets of cases.

* **Multiple imputation** A *data based method* that works with the whole raw data file (not just with the observed variables that comprise the researcher's model). Multiple imputation assumes that data are MAR (remember, MCAR is the more prestigious one).  This means that researchers assume that missing values can be replaced by predictions derived from the observable portion fo the dataset.

  - Multiple datasets (often 5 to 20) are created where missing values are replaced via a randomized process (so the same missing value [item 4 for person A] will likely have different values for each dataset).
  - The desired anlayis(es) is conducted simultaneously/separately for each of the imputed sets (so if you imputed 5 sets and wanted a linear regression, you get 5 linear regressions).
  - A *pooled analysis* uses the point estimates and the standard errors to provide a single result that represents the analysis.

### Available Information Analysis (AIA)

Parent [-@parent_handling_2013] has created a set of recommendations that help us create a streamlined workflow for managing missing data.  After evaluating three approaches to managing missingness (AIA, mean substitution, and multiple imputation) Parent concluded that in datasets with (a) low levels of missingness, (b) a reasonable sample size, and (c) adequate internal reliability of measures, these approaches had similar results.  

Further, in simulation studies where there was (a) low sample size (*n* = 50), (b) weak associations among items, and (c) a small number of missing items, AIA was equivalent to multiple imputation.  Even in cases where the data conditions were the "best" (i.e., *N* = 200, moderate correlations, at least 10 items), even 10% missingness (overall) did not produce notable difference among the methods.  That is, means, standard errors, and alphas were similar across the methods (AIA, mean substitution, multiple imputation).

AIA is an older method of handling missing data that, as its name suggests, uses the *available data* for analysis and excludes missing data points only for analyses in which the missing data point would be directly involved.  This means

* In the case of research that uses multiple item scales, and analysis takes place at the scale level
  - AIA is used to generate **mean** scores for the scale using the available data without substituting or imputing values;
  - This method generally produces a fairly complete set of scale-level data where 
     * pairwise deletion (the whole row/case/person is skipped) can be used where there will be multiple analyses using statistics (e.g., correlations, t-tests, ANOVA) were missingness is not permitted
     * FIML can be specified in path analysisand CFA/SEM (where item-level data is required), and
     * some statistics, such as principal components analysis and principal axis factoring (item-level analyses) permit missing data, 
  - Of course, the researcher could still impute data, but why...
  
Parent's [-@parent_handling_2013] recommendations: 

* Scale scores should be first calculated as a *mean* (average) not a sum. Why?
   - Calculating a "sum" from available data will result in automatically lower scores in cases where there is missingness.
   - If a sum is required (i.e., because you want to interpret some clinical level of something), calculate the mean first, do the analyses, then transform the results back into the whole-scale equivalent (multiply the mean by the number of items) for any interpretation.
   - For R script, do not write the script ([item1 + item2 + item3]/3) because this will return an empty entry for participants missing data (same problem as if you were to use sum).  There are several functions for properly computing a mean; I will demo the *mean_n()* function from *sjstats* package because it allows us to simultaneously specify the tolerance level (next item).
* Determine your *tolerance* for missingness (20% seems to be common, although you could also look for guidance in the test manual/article). Then
  - Run a "percent missingness" check on the level of analysis (i.e., total score, scale, or subscale) you are using. If you are using a total scale score, then check to see what percent is missing across all the items in the whole scale.  In contrast, if you are looking at subscales, run the percent missing at that level.
  - Parent [-@parent_handling_2013] advised that the tolerance levels should be made mindfully.  A four-item scale with one item missing, won't meet the 80% threshold, so it may make sense to set a 75% threshold for this scale.
* "Clearly and concisely detail the level of missingness" in papers [@parent_handling_2013, p. 595].  This includes
  - tolerance level for missing data by scale or subscale (e.g., 80% or 75%)
  - the number of missing values out of all data points on that scale for all participants and the maximum by participant (e.g., "For Scale X, a total of # missing data points out of ### were observed with no participant missing more than a single point.")
  - verify a manual inspection of missing data for obvious patterns (e.g., abnormally high missing rates for only one or two items).  This can be accomplished by requesting frequency output for the items and checking the nonmissing data points for each scale, ensuring there are no abnormal spikes in missingness (looking for MNAR).
* Curiously, Parent [-@parent_handling_2013] does not recommend that we run all the diagnostic tests. However, because recent reviewers have required them of me, I will demonstrate a series of them.
* Reducing missingness starts at the survey design -- make sure that all people can answer all items (i.e,. relationship-related items may contain heterosexist assumptions...which would result in an MNAR circumstance)

Very practically speaking, Parent's [-@parent_handling_2013] recommendations follow us through the entire data analysis process.  

## Working the Problem

In the prior chapter we imported the data from Qualtrics and applied the broadest levels of inclusion (e.g., the course rated was offered from an institution in the U.S., the respondent consented to participation) and exclusion (e.g., the survey was not a preview). We then downsized the survey to include the variables we will use in our statistical model. We then saved the data in a .csv file. 

Presuming that you are working along with me in an .rmd file, if you have placed that file in the same folder as this .rmd file, the following code should read the data into your environment.

I use *different* names for the object/df in my R environment than I use for the filename that holds the data on my computer.  Why?  I don't want to accidentally overwrite this precious "source" of data.

```{r read in data from csv}
scrub_df <- read.csv ("BlackStntsModel210318.csv", head = TRUE, sep = ",")
str(scrub_df)
```

Let's think about how the variables in our model should be measured:

* DV: Campus Climate for Black Students (as perceived by the respondent) 
  - mean score of the 6 items on that scale (higher scores indicate a climate characterized by hostility, nonresponsiveness, and stigma)
  - 1 item needs to be reverse-coded
  - this scale was adapted from the LGBT Campus Climate Scale [@szymanski_perceptions_2020]
* IV:  Belonging
  - mean score for the 3 items on that scale (higher scores indicate a greater sense of belonging)
  - this scale is taken from the Sense of Belonging subscale from the Perceived Cohesion Scale [@bollen_perceived_1990]
* Proportion of classmates who are Black
  - a single item
* Proportion of instructional staff who are BIPOC
  - must be calculated from each of the single items for each instructor
  
Our next step is to conduct a preliminary missing data analysis at the item level, across the dataset we are using. The Campus Climate and Belonging scales are traditional in the sense that they have items that we sum. The variable representing proportion of classmates who are Black is a single item. The variable representing the proportion of instructional staff who are BIPOC must be calculated in a manner that takes into consideration the there may be multiple instructors. The survey allowed a respondent to name up to 10 instructors.

```{r str of iRace1}
str(scrub_df$iRace1)
```


Looking at the structure of our data, the iRace(1 thru 10) variables are in "int" or integer format.  This means that they are represented as whole numbers.  We need them to be represented as factors. R handles factors represented as words well.  Therefore, let's use our codebook to reformat this variable as a an ordered factor, with words instead of numbers.

Qualtrics imports many of the categorical variables as numbers.  R often reads them numerically (integers or numbers). If they are directly converted to factors, R will sometimes collapse across missing numbers.  In this example, if there is a race that is not represented (e.g., 2 for BiMulti), when the numbers are changed to factors, R will assume they are ordered and there is a consecutive series of numbers (0,1,2,3,4).  If a number in the sequence is missing (0,1,3,4) and labels are applied, it will collapse across the numbers and the labels you think are attached to each number are not.  Therefore, it is ESSENTIAL to check (again and again ad nauseum) to ensure that your variables are recoding in a manner you understand.

One way to avoid this is to use the code below to identify the levels and the labels.  When they are in order, they align and don't "skip" numbers. To quadruple check our work, we will recode into a new variable "tRace#" for "teacher" Race.

```{r creating factors for the iRace variable}
scrub_df$tRace1 = factor(scrub_df$iRace1,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
scrub_df$tRace2 = factor(scrub_df$iRace2,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
scrub_df$tRace3 = factor(scrub_df$iRace3,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
scrub_df$tRace4 = factor(scrub_df$iRace4,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
scrub_df$tRace5 = factor(scrub_df$iRace5,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
scrub_df$tRace6 = factor(scrub_df$iRace6,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
scrub_df$tRace7 = factor(scrub_df$iRace7,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
scrub_df$tRace8 = factor(scrub_df$iRace8,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
scrub_df$tRace9 = factor(scrub_df$iRace9,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
scrub_df$tRace10 = factor(scrub_df$iRace10,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
```

Let's check the structure to see if they are factors.

```{r glimps of the scrub_df}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(scrub_df)
```

Calculating the proportion of the BIPOC instructional staff could likely be accomplished a number of ways.  My searching for solutions resulted in this. Hopefully it's a fair balance between intuitive and elegant coding.  First, I created code that 

* created a new variable (count.BIPOC) by
  * summing across the tRace1 through tRace10 variables,
  * assigning a count of "1" each time the factor value was Black, nBpoc, or BiMulti
```{r count not-White instructional staff}
scrub_df$count.BIPOC <- apply(scrub_df[c("tRace1", "tRace2", "tRace3", "tRace4", "tRace5", "tRace6", "tRace7", "tRace8", "tRace9", "tRace10")], 1, function(x) sum(x %in% c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti")))
```

Next, I created a variable that counted the number of non-missing values across the tRace1 through tRace10 variables.
```{r count non-missing}
scrub_df$count.nMiss <- apply(scrub_df[c("tRace1", "tRace2", "tRace3", "tRace4", "tRace5", "tRace6", "tRace7", "tRace8", "tRace9", "tRace10")], 1, function(x) sum(!is.na(x)))
```

Now to calculate the proportion of BIPOC instructional faculty for each case.
```{r}
scrub_df$iBIPOC_pr = scrub_df$count.BIPOC/scrub_df$count.nMiss
```


### Missing Data Analysis:  Whole df and Item level

In understanding missingness across the dataset, I think it is important to analyze and manage it, iteratively.  We will start with a view of the whole df-level missingness. Subsequently, and consistent with the available information analysis [AIA; @parent_handling_2013] approach, we will score the scales and then look again at missingness, using the new information to update our decisions about how to manage it.

![An image of our stage in the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.](images/Ch02/wrkflow_item_lvl.jpg)

Because we just created a host of new variables in creating the *prop_BIPOC* variable, let's downsize the df so that the calculations are sensible.

```{r}
scrub_df <-(select (scrub_df, ID, iBIPOC_pr, cmBlack, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6))
```

With a couple of calculations, we create a proportion of item-level missingness.

In this chunk I first calculate the number of missing (nmiss)

```{r degree of item level missingness}
#Calculating number and proportion of item-level missingness
scrub_df$nmiss <- scrub_df%>%
    select(iBIPOC_pr:Blst_6) %>% #the colon allows us to include all variables between the two listed (the variables need to be in order)
    is.na %>% 
    rowSums

scrub_df<- scrub_df%>%
  mutate(prop_miss = (nmiss/11)*100) #11 is the number of variables included in calculating the proportion
```

We can grab the descriptives for the *prop_miss* variable to begin to understand our data.  I will create an object from it so I can use it with inline
```{r desriptives of proportion missing}
library(formattable)
CaseMiss<-psych::describe(scrub_df$prop_miss)
CaseMiss
missMin <- digits(CaseMiss$min, 0)
missMax <- digits(CaseMiss$max, 0)
```

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP:  Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from `r missMin`% to `r missMax`%.

At the time that I am lecturing this, the the amount of missing is not so egregious that I want to eliminate any cases. That is, I'm willing to wait until after I score the items to make further decisions, then. 

Because (a) I want to teach it and (b) it is quite likely that we will receive responses with high levels of missingness, I will write code to eliminate cases with $\geq$ 90%.

```{r eliminate missing based on proportion of item level missingness}
scrub_df <- filter(scrub_df, prop_miss <= 90)  #update df to have only those with at least 90% of complete data
```

To analyze missingness at this level, we need a df that has only the variables of interest.  That is, variables like *ID* and the *prop_miss* and *nmiss* variables we created will interfere with an accurate assessment of missingness. I will update our df to eliminate these.  

```{r df for analyzing missingness}
scrub_df <- scrub_df %>%
  select (-c(ID, nmiss, prop_miss))#further update to exclude the n_miss and prop_miss variables
```

Missing data analysis commonly looks at proportions by:

* the entire df
* rows/cases/people

```{r calculate proportions of cells and cases w missing}
#install.packages("formattable")
CellsMiss <- percent(mean(is.na(scrub_df)))#what proportion of cells missing across entire dataset
CaseComplete <- percent(mean(complete.cases(scrub_df)))#what proportion of cases (rows) are complete (nonmissing)
CellsMiss
CaseComplete
```

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from `r missMin`% to `r missMax`%.  Across the dataset, `r CellsMiss` of cells had missing data and `r CaseComplete` of cases had nonmissing data.


### Analyzing Missing Data Patterns

One approach to analyzing missing data is to assess patterns of missingness. 

Several R packages are popularly used for conducting such analyses.  In the *mice* package, *md.pattern()* function provides a matrix with the number of columns + 1, in which each row corresponds to a missing data pattern (1 = observed, 0 = missing).  

Rows and columns are sorted in increasing amounts of missing information.  

The last column and row contain row and column counts, respectively.  

```{r item level missingness w mice, eval=FALSE}
#Using the package: mice
library(mice)

mice_out <- md.pattern(scrub_df, plot = TRUE, rotate.names = TRUE)
mice_out
write.csv (mice_out, file="mice_out.csv") #optional to write it to a .csv file
```

The table lets you look at each missing pattern and see which variable(s) is/are missing. The output is in the form of a table that indicates the frequency of each pattern of missingness.  Because I haven't (yet) figured out how to pipe objects from this table into the chapter, this text may dier from the patterns in the current data frame.

Each row in the table represents a different pattern of missingness.  At the time of writing, there are *6* patterns of missing data. The patterns are listed in descending order of the least amount of missingness. The most common pattern (*23* cases, top row) is one with no missing data. One cases (is missing three cells -- three of the items assessing the campus climate for Black students, and so forth. *These numbers are not piped and subject to change.*

In general, the data patterns represented a haphazard patterns of responding [@enders_applied_2010].


### Missing Mechanisms

Remember Little's MCAR test.  Recently it has a history of appearing, working with glitches, disappearing, and so forth.  At the present time I cannot find a package that is working well.  When I do, I will add this section.


## Scoring

So let's get to work to score up the measures for our analysis. Each step of this should involve careful cross-checking with the [codebook](./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf).

### Reverse scoring

As we discovered previously, in the scale that assesses campus climate (higher scores reflect a more negative climate) one of our items (Blst_1, "My *institution* provides a supportive environment for Black students.") requires reverse-coding.

To rescore:

* Create a *new* variable (this is essential) that is designated as the reversed item.  We might put a the letter "r" (for reverse scoring) at the beginning or end:  rBlst_1 or Blst_1r. It does not matter; just be consistent.
  - We don't reverse score into the same variable because when you rerun the script, it just re-reverses the reversed score...into infinity. It's very easy to lose your place.
* The reversal is an *equation* where you subtract the value in the item from the range/scaling + 1.  For the our three items we subtract each item's value from 8.

```{r reverse scoring}
scrub_df<- scrub_df %>%
  mutate(rBlst_1 = 8 - Blst_1) #if you had multiple items, you could add a pipe (%>%) at the end of the line and add more until the last one
```

Per Parent [-@parent_handling_2013] we will analyze missingness for each scale, separately.  

* We will calculate scale scores on each scale separately when 80% (roughly) of the data is present.
  - this is somewhat arbitrary, on 4 item scales, I would choose 75% (to allow one to be missing)
  - on the 3 item scale, I will allow one item to be missing (65%)
* After calculating the scale scores, we will return to analyzing the missingness, looking at the whole df

The *mean_n()* function of *sjstats* package has allows you to specify how many items (whole number) or what percentage of items should be present in order to get the mean. First, though, we should identify the variables (properly formatted, if rescoring was needed) that should be included in the calculation of each scale and subscale.

In our case, the scale assessing belonging [@bollen_perceived_1990; @hurtado_effects_1997] involves three items with no reversals. Our campus climate scale was adapted from Szymanski et al.'s LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale [@szymanski_perceptions_2020]. While it has not been psychometrically evaluated for the purpose for which I am using it, I will follow the scoring structure in the journal article that introduces the measure. Specifically, the factor structure permits a total scale score and two subscales representing the college response and stigma.

```{r Scoring scales}
library(sjstats)
#Making the list of variables
Belonging_vars <- c('Belong_1','Belong_2','Belong_3')
ResponseBL_vars <- c('rBlst_1', 'Blst_4','Blst_6')
StigmaBL_vars <- c('Blst_2', 'Blst_3','Blst_5')
ClimateBL_vars <- c('rBlst_1', 'Blst_4','Blst_6','Blst_2', 'Blst_3','Blst_5' )

#Creating the new variables
scrub_df$Belonging <- mean_n(scrub_df[,Belonging_vars], .65)
scrub_df$ResponseBL <- mean_n(scrub_df[,ResponseBL_vars], .80)
scrub_df$StigmaBL <- mean_n(scrub_df[,StigmaBL_vars], .80)
scrub_df$ClimateBL <- mean_n(scrub_df[,ClimateBL_vars], .80)
```

Later it will be helpful to have a df with the item and scale-level variables.  It will also be helpful if there is an ID for each case.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
scrub_df <- scrub_df %>% mutate(ID = row_number())

#moving the ID number to the first column; requires 
scrub_df <- scrub_df%>%select(ID, everything())
```


Let's save our *scrub_df* data for this and write it as an outfile.

```{r write scrub_df as outfile}
write.table(scrub_df, file="BlStItmsScrs210320.csv", sep=",", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)
```


## Missing Analysis:  Scale level 

Let's return to analyzing the missingness, this time including the *scale level* variables (without the individual items) that will be in our statistical model(s). 

![An image of our stage in the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.](images/Ch02/wrkflow_scale_lvl.jpg)

First let's get the df down to the variables we want to retain:

```{r Filtering in scored variables}
scored <-(select (scrub_df, iBIPOC_pr, cmBlack, Belonging, ResponseBL, StigmaBL, ClimateBL))
ScoredCaseMiss <- nrow(scored) #I produced this object for the sole purpose of feeding the number of cases into the inline text, below
```

Before we start our formal analysis of missingness at the scale level, let's continue to scrub by eliminating cases that clearly won't remain. In the script below we create a variable that counts the number of missing variables and then creates a proportion by dividing it by the number of total variables.

Using the *describe()* function from the *psych* package, we can investigate this variable.

```{r row missingness for scoed variables}
library(psych)
#Create a variable (n_miss) that counts the number missing
scored$n_miss <- scored%>%
select(iBIPOC_pr:ClimateBL) %>% 
is.na %>% 
rowSums

#Create a proportion missing by dividing n_miss by the total number of variables (6)
#Pipe to sort in order of descending frequency to get a sense of the missingness
scored<- scored%>%
mutate(prop_miss = (n_miss/6)*100)%>%
  arrange(desc(n_miss))

ScoredPrMiss <- psych::describe(scored$prop_miss)
ScoredPrMiss
ScrdMissMin <- digits(ScoredPrMiss$min, 0)#this object is displayed below and I use input from  it for the inline text used in the write-up
ScrdMissMax <- digits(ScoredPrMiss$max, 0)
ScrdMissMin
ScrdMissMax
```
CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP:  Across the `r ScoredCaseMiss` cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from `r ScrdMissMin`% to `r ScrdMissMax`%.

We need to decide what is our retention threshhold. Twenty percent seems to be a general rule of thumb.  Let's delete all cases with missingness at 20% or greater.

```{r delete missing greater than 20%}
scored <- filter(scored, prop_miss <= 20)  #update df to have only those with at least 20% of complete data (this is an arbitrary decision)

scored <-(select (scored, iBIPOC_pr:ClimateBL)) #the variable selection just lops off the proportion missing

ScoredCasesIncluded <- nrow(scored)
ScoredCasesIncluded #this object is displayed below and I use input from  it for the inline text used in the write-up
```

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP:  Across the `r ScoredCaseMiss` cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from `r ScrdMissMin`% to `r ScrdMissMax`%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20% missing, the dataset analyzed included `r ScoredCasesIncluded` cases. 

With a decision about the number of cases we are going to include, we can continue to analyze missingness.

## Revisiting Missing Analysis at the Scale Level

We work with a df that includes only the variables in our model.  In our case this is easy.  In other cases (i.e., maybe there is an ID number) it might be good to create a subset just for this analysis.

Again, we look at missingness as the proportion of 

* individual cells across the dataset, and
* rows/cases with nonmissing data

```{r Scale level missing data summaries}
PrScoredCellsMissing <-percent(mean(is.na(scored))) #percent missing across df
PrScoredRowsMissing <- percent(mean(complete.cases(scored))) #percent of rows with nonmissing data
PrScoredCellsMissing
PrScoredRowsMissing
```


CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across the `r ScoredCaseMiss` cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from `r ScrdMissMin`% to `r ScrdMissMax`%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20% missing, the dataset analyzed included `r ScoredCasesIncluded` cases. In this dataset we had `r PrScoredCellsMissing` missing across the df; `r PrScoredRowsMissing` of the rows had nonmissing data.

Let's look again at missing patterns and mechanisms.

### Scale Level:  Patterns of Missing Data

Returning to the *mice* package, we can use the *md.pattern()* function to examine a matrix with the number of columns + 1 in which each row corresponds to a missing data pattern (1 = observed, 0 = missing). The rows and columns are sorted in increasing amounts of missing information. The last column and row contain row and column counts, respectively.

```{r scale level missingness w mice, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Using the package: mice
library(mice)
mice_ScaleLvl <- md.pattern(scored, plot = TRUE, rotate.names=TRUE)
```

At the scale-level, this is much easier to interpret.  As I am lecturing the results today (the numbers will change) there are *2* rows of data because there are only *2* patterns of missingness. The most common pattern is non-missing data (*n* = 26). 


### Is it MCAR?

As noted earlier, I cannot find an MCAR package.  This is a placeholder for updating this portion of the lecture when one becomes readily available (and I learn about it)


### R-eady for Analysis

At this stage the data is ready for analysis (data diagnostics). With the AIA approach [@parent_handling_2013] the following preliminary analyses would involve pairwise deletion (i.e., the row/case is dropped for that analysis, but included for all others):

![An image of our stage in the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.](images/Ch02/wrkflow_AIAready.jpg)

* data diagnostics
  +  psychometric properties of scales, such as alpha coefficients
  +  assessing assumptions such as univariate and multivariate normality, outliers, etc.
* preliminary analyses
  +  descriptives (means/standard deviations, frequencies)
  +  correlation matrices

AIA can also be used with primary analyses.  Examples of how to manage missingness include:

* ANOVA/regression models
  +  if completed with ordinary least squares, pairwise deletion would be utilized
* SEM/CFA models with observed, latent, or hybrid models
  + if FIML (we'll discuss later) is specified, all cases are used, even when there is missingness
* EFA models
  + these can handle item-level missingness
* Hierarchical linear modeling/multilevel modeling/mixed effects modeling
  + While all data needs to be present for a given cluster/wave, it is permissible to have varying numbers of clusters/waves per case
  
## The APA Style Write-Up

## Results

All analyses were completed in R Studio (v. 1.4.1106) with R (v. 4.0.4). 

**Missing Data Analysis and Treatment of Missing Data**

Available item analysis (AIA; [@parent_handling_2013]) is a strategy for managing missing data that uses available data for analysis and excludes cases with missing data points only for analyses in which the data points would be directly involved. Parent (2013) suggested that AIA is equivalent to more complex methods (e.g., multiple imputation) across a number of variations of sample size, magnitude of associations among items, and degree of missingness. Thus, we utilized Parent’s recommendations to guide our approach to managing missing data. Missing data analyses were conducted with tools in base R as well as the R packages, *psych* (v. 1.0.12) and *mice* (v. 3.13.0). 

Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from `r missMin`% to `r missMax`%.  Across the dataset, `r CellsMiss` of cells had missing data and `r CaseComplete` of cases had nonmissing data. At this stage in the analysis, we allowed all cases with less than 90% missing to continue to the scoring stage. Guided by Parent's [-@parent_handling_2013] AIA approach, scales with three items were scored if at least two items were non-missing; the scale with four items was scored if it at least three non-missing items; and the scale with six items was scored if it had at least five non-missing items. 

Across the `r ScoredCaseMiss` cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from `r ScrdMissMin`% to `r ScrdMissMax`%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20% missing, the dataset analyzed included `r ScoredCasesIncluded` cases. In this dataset we had `r PrScoredCellsMissing` missing across the df; `r PrScoredRowsMissing` of the rows had nonmissing data.

## Practice Problems

The three problems described below are designed to be continuations from the previous chapter (Scrubbing). You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis.

### Problem #1: Reworking the Chapter Problem

If you chose this option in the prior chapter, you imported the data from Qualtrics, applied inclusion/exclusion criteria, renamed variables, downsized the df to the variables of interest, and wrote up the preliminary results.

### Problem #2:  Use the *Rate-a-Recent-Course* Survey, Choosing Different Variables

If you chose this option in the prior chapter, you chose a minimum of three variables from the *Rate-a-Recent-Course* survey to include in a simple statistical model. You imported the dat from Qualtrics, applied inclusion/exclusion criteria, renamed variables, downsized the df to the variables of interest and wrote up the preliminary results.

 [Screencasted Lecture Link](https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?pid=43dbe818-8186-498d-8e84-acf7000acb5b) 

The focus of this chapter engage in *data diagnostics*, that is, to evaluate the appropriateness of the data for the *specific research model we are going to evaluate*. We are asking the question, "Does the data have the appropriate characteristics for the analysis we want to perform?" Some statistics are more robust than others to violations of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data. None-the-less, we must report these characteristics when we disseminate the results.

## Navigating this Lesson

There is about 45 minutes of lecture.  If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail.  All original materials are provided at the [Github site](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling) that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's [introduction](#ReCintro)

### Learning Objectives

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

* Conduct and interpret critical data diagnostics, including
  * alpha coefficients
  * skew
  * kurtosis
* Assess univariate and multivariate normality
* Identify options for managing outliers and skewed data
* Articulate a workflow for data preparation, including scrubbing, scoring, and data diagnostics


### Planning for Practice

The suggestions from practice are a continuation from the two prior chapters. If you have completed one or more of those assignments, you should have started with a raw dataset and then scrubbed and scored it. This chapter will involve running basic data diagnostics. Options of graded complexity could incude:

* Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written.
* Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose.
* Begin with raw data to which you have access.

The same workflow guides us through the Scrubbing, Scoring, and Data Dx chapters.  At this stage we have 

* imported our raw data from Qualtrics, 
* scrubbed the data by applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
* used Parent's available information approach [AIA; -@parent_handling_2013] for determining the acceptable amount of missingness for each scale, and
* prepared variables and scored them.

We are now ready to engage in data diagnostics for the statistical model we will test.

## Research Vignette

The research vignette comes from the survey titled, [Rate-a-Recent-Course:  A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise](https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU) and is explained in the [scrubbing chapter](#scrub). In the [scoring chapter](#score) we prepared four variables for analysis. Details for these are in our [codebook](./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf).

Variable recap:

* Perceived Campus Climate for Black Students includes 6 items, one of which was reverse scored. This scale was adapted from Szymanski et al.'s [-@szymanski_perceptions_2020] Campus Climate for LGBTQ students. It has not been evaluated for use with other groups.  The Szymanski et al. analysis suggested that it could be used as a total scale score, or divided into three items each that assess
  * College response to LGBTQ students (items 6, 4, 1)
  * LGBTQ stigma (items 3, 2, 5)
* Sense of Belonging includes 3 items. This is a subscale from Bollen and Hoyle's [-@bollen_perceived_1990] Perceived Cohesion Scale. There are no items on this scale that require reversing.
* Percent of Black classmates is a single item that asked respondents to estimate the proportion of students in various racial categories
* Percent of BIPOC instructional staff, similarly, asked respondents to identify the racial category of each member of their instructional staff

As we noted in the [scrubbing chapter](#scrub), our design has notable limitations. Briefly, (a) owing to the open source aspect of the data we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent; (b) the items that ask respondents to *guess* the identities of the instructional staff and to place them in broad categories, (c) we do not provide a "write-in" a response. We made these decisions after extensive conversation with stakeholders. The primary reason for these decisions was to prevent potential harm (a) to respondents who could be identified if/when the revealed private information in this open-source survey, and (b) trolls who would write inappropriate or harmful comments. 
  
As I think about "how these variables go together" (which is often where I start in planning a study), imagine a parallel mediation.  That is the perception of campus climate for Black students would be predicted by the respondent's sense of belonging, mediated in separate paths through the proportion of classmates who are Black and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff.  

*I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the %Black instructional staff.  At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this.* 

![An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data.](images/Ch04/BlStuMed.jpg)

I will finish up this chapter by conducting a regression. Because parallel mediation can be complicated (I teach it in a later chapter), I will demonstrate use of our prepared variables with a simple multiple regression.

![An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data.](images/Ch04/BlStuRegression.jpg)


First, though, let's take a more conceptual look at issues regarding missing data.  We'll come back to details of the survey as we work with it.

## Internal Consistency of Scales/Subscales

Alpha coefficients are *reliability coefficients* that assess the *internal consistency* of an instrument. It asks, "For each person, are responses *consistently* high, or medium, or low?"  To the degree that they are (meaning there are high inter-item correlations), the internal consistency coefficient will be high.  We want values >.80.  There are numerous problems with alpha coefficients.  The biggest one is that they are influenced by sample size -- longer scales have higher alpha coefficients [@cortina_what_1993].  Fourteen seems to be a magic number where we begin to not trust the high alpha coefficient. I address this more thoroughly -- offering an alternative -- in psychometrics. While there is much criticism about the usefulness of the alpha coefficient [@sijtsma_use_2009], researchers continue to use the alpha coefficient as an indicator of the internal consistency of scales that consist of multiple items and contain several variables.  

We need item level data to compute an alpha coefficient. The easiest way to get an alpha coefficient is to feed the *alpha()* function (*psych* package) a contatonated list of items (with any items already reverse-scored). There should be no extra items. In the [scoring chapter](#score) we already reverse-coded the single item in the campus climate scale, so we are ready to calculate alphas. 

The df from which I am pulling data was created and written as an outfile in the [scoring chapter](#score). This particular df has item-level data.

```{r import item level data for alpha coefficients}
item_scores_df <- read.csv ("BlStItmsScrs210320.csv", head = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

From this, we create tiny dfs, one for each of the alpha coefficients we need to create. A priori, we are planning to use all six items of the campus climate scale. We'll go ahead and also calculate the subscales because (a) it's good practice and (b) if the alpha is low, a *reason* might show up in one of the subscales.


```{r Belonging alpha}
library(psych)
library(formattable)
Bel_alpha <- psych::alpha(item_scores_df[c("Belong_1", "Belong_2", "Belong_3")])
Bel_alpha
```
CAPTURE FOR THE APA STYLE WRITE-UP(since these are generally placed in the description of each measure in the Method section, I am not doing a cumulative capture):  Cronbach's alpha for the belonging scale was `r digits(Bel_alpha$total$raw_alpha, 3)`.


```{r Campus Climate alpha}
CClim_alpha <- psych::alpha(item_scores_df[c("rBlst_1", "Blst_2", "Blst_3", "Blst_4", "Blst_5", "Blst_6")])
CClim_alpha

```
CAPTURE FOR THE APA STYLE WRITE-UP (since these are generally placed in the description of each measure in the Method section, I am not doing a cumulative capture):  Cronbach's alpha for the campus climate scale was `r digits(CClim_alpha$total$raw_alpha, 3)`. Since this value is $\geq$ .80, it is within the realm of acceptability. Let's go ahead, though, and look at its subscales.


```{r Stigma alpha}
Stigma_alpha <- psych::alpha(item_scores_df[c("Blst_3", "Blst_2", "Blst_5")])
Stigma_alpha

```
 Cronbach's alpha for the campus climate stigma subscale was `r digits(Stigma_alpha$total$raw_alpha, 3)`. 

```{r Responsive alpha}
Resp_alpha <- psych::alpha(item_scores_df[c("rBlst_1", "Blst_4", "Blst_6")])
Resp_alpha
```

Cronbach's alpha for the campus climate responsiveness subscale was `r digits(Resp_alpha$total$raw_alpha, 3)`.  Between the two subscales, it looks as if the responsivenes subscale is more internally consistent. 

## Distributional Characteristics of the Variables

### Evaluating Univariate Normality

Statistics like ANOVA and regression each have a set of assumptions about the distributional characteristics of the data. In most of the chapters in this OER we review those assumptions and how to evaluate them.  Common across many statistics is the requirement of univariate and multivariate normality.  Let's take a look at the variables we will use in our analysis and assess those.

We can continue to work from the df we uploaded at the beginning of the chapter to do this work.  Let's take a quick peek.  This df has the item-level data (we used it for the alpha coefficients); the scale and subscale scores; and the two items that assess proportion of instructional staff that are BIPOC and proportion of classmates that are BIPOC.

The *str()* function let's us look at the variable format/measurement level of each variable. 
```{r}
str(item_scores_df)
```
The difference between "int" (integer) and "num" (numerical) is that integers are limited to whole numbers. In the functions used in this chapter, both are acceptable formats for the variables.

```{r}
# the script may look a little complicated; I could have simply written
# describe(item_scores_df) #it would have given me descriptives for all the items in the df
# because I only wanted a few variables, I provided them in a concatenated: list [c("iBIPOC_pr", "cmBlack", "Belonging", "ClimateBL")]
# I also added "psych::" in front of the command to make sure that R is using the describe function from the psych package
# I popped the output into an object; objects are not required, but can be helpful to write as outfiles, to pipe elements of inline text, and to use with packages like apaTables
# When we use an object, we need to write it below so the results will display
descriptives <- (psych::describe(item_scores_df[c("iBIPOC_pr", "cmBlack", "Belonging", "ClimateBL")]))
descriptives
write.csv (descriptives, file="DataDx_descripts.csv") #this can be useful if you wish to manually format the data for an APA style table
```

To understand whether our data are normally distributed, we can look at skew and kurtosis.  The skew and kurtosis indices in the psych package are reported as *z* scores.  Regarding skew, values > 3.0 are generally considered "severely skewed."  Regarding kurtosis, "severely kurtotic" is argued anywhere > 8 to 20 [@kline_principles_2016].  At the time I am writing this chapter, our skew and kurtosis values fall below the thresholds that Kline identified as concerning.

We can also apply the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality to each of our variables. When the $p$ value is < .05, the variable's distribution is deviates from a normal distribution to a degree that is statistically significant. Below, the plotting of the histogram with a normal curve superimposed shows how the distribution approximates one that is normal.

```{r Shapiro Wilk tests of univariate normality}
#The shapiro-test is in base R; it's specification is simple:  shapiro.test(df$variable)
#I added the object (and had to list it below) so I can use the inline text function
SWt_i <- shapiro.test(item_scores_df$iBIPOC_pr)
SWt_cm <- shapiro.test(item_scores_df$cmBlack)
SWt_Bel <-shapiro.test(item_scores_df$Belonging)
SWt_Cl <-shapiro.test(item_scores_df$ClimateBL)
SWt_i
SWt_cm
SWt_Bel
SWt_Cl
```

```{r extracting Shapiro Wilks objects, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}

iSW <- digits(SWt_i$statistic, 3)
iSWp <- digits(SWt_i$p.value, 4)
iSW
iSWp

cmSW <- digits(SWt_cm$statistic, 3)
cmSWp <- digits(SWt_cm$p.value, 4)
cmSW
cmSWp

belSW <- digits(SWt_Bel$statistic, 3)
belSWp <- digits(SWt_Bel$p.value, 4)
belSW
belSWp

clSW <- digits(SWt_Cl$statistic, 3)
clSWp <- digits(SWt_Cl$p.value, 4)
clSW
clSWp
```

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR THE APA STYLE WRITE-UP:  Regarding the distributional characteristics of the data, skew and kurtosis values of the variables fell below the values of 3 (skew) and 8 to 20 (kurtosis) that Kline suggests are concerning [-@kline_principles_2016]. Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicate that our variables assessing the proportion of classmates who are Black ($W$ = `r cmSW`, $p$ = `r cmSWp`) and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff($W$ = `r iSW`, $p$ = `r iSWp`)  are statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. The scales assessing the respondent's belonging ($W$ = `r belSW`, $p$ = `r belSWp`) and the respondent's perception of campus climate for Black students ($W$ = `r clSW`, $p$ = `r clSWp`) did not differ differently from a normal distribution.

*Note.  Owing to the open nature of the dataset, these values will change.  While I have used inline text to update the values of the Shapiro Wilks' and associated significance test, the text narration is not automatically updated and may be inconsistent with the results.*

What would we do in the case of a univariate outlier? I find Kline's [-@kline_principles_2016] chapter on data preparation and management to be extremely useful. He provides ideas for more complex analysis of both univariate and multivariate normality and provides suggestions that range from recoding an extreme value to the next most extreme that is within three standard deviations of the mean to more complicated transformations. First, though we need to further examine the relationships between variables.  We do that, next.

### Pairs Panels

As we work our way from univariate to multivariate inspection of our data, let's take a look at the bivariate relations.

The *pairs.panels()* function from the *psych* package is useful for showing the relationship between variables (probably no more than 10) in a model.

* The lower half is a scatterplot between the two variables with a regression line (red) and mean (dot).  
* The diagonal is a histogram of each variable.  
* The upper half of is the correlation coefficient between the two variables.

```{r pairs panels}
psych::pairs.panels(item_scores_df[c("iBIPOC_pr", "cmBlack", "Belonging", "ClimateBL")], stars = TRUE, lm = TRUE)
```

The histograms displayed in the diagonal graph for us what we learned from the Shapiro Wilk's test of normality.  We can clearly see the non-normal distribution in the iBIPOC_pr and cmBlack variables.


## Evaluating Multivariate Normality

**Multivariate outliers** have extreme scores on two or more variables, or a pattern of scores that is atypical.  For example, a case may have scores between two and three standard deviations above the mean on all variables, even though no case would be extreme.  A common method of multivariate outlier detection is the  **Mahalanobis distance** ($D_{M}^{2}$).  This indicates the  distance in variance units between the profile of scores for that case and the vector of sample means, or **centroid**, correcting for intercorrelations.

The *outlier()* function from the *psych* package tells us how far each datapoint is from the multivariate centroid of the data.  That is, find the squared Mahalanobis distance for each data point and compare it to the expected values of $\chi^2$.  The *outlier()* protocol also produces a Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot with the *n* most extreme data points labeled. 

The code below appends the Mahalanobis values to the dataframe.  It is easy, then, to identify, sort, and examine the most extreme values (relative to the rest of the data in their case/row) to make decisions about their retention or adjustment.

Numeric variables are required in the for the calculation of the Mahalanobis.

```{r Detect multivariate outliers}
item_scores_df$Mahal <- psych::outlier(item_scores_df[c("iBIPOC_pr", "cmBlack", "Belonging", "ClimateBL")]) 
```

Q-Q plots take your sample data, sort it in ascending order, and then plot them versus quantiles (the number varies; you can see it on the X axis) calculated from a theoretical distribution. The number of quantiles is selected to match the size of your sample data. While Normal Q-Q Plots are the ones most often used in practice due to so many statistical methods assuming normality, Q-Q Plots can actually be created for any distribution. To the degree that the plotted line stays on the straight line (representing the theoretical normal distribution), the data is multivariate normally distributed.

It is possible, then to analyze the Mahalanobis distance values.

```{r Mahalanobis descriptives}
psych::describe(item_scores_df$Mahal)
```

Using this information we can determine cases that have a Mahalanobis distance values that exceeds three standard deviations around the median.  In fact, we can have these noted in a column in the dataframe.

```{r warning=FALSE }
library(dplyr)
#str(item_scores_df$Mahal)
item_scores_df$MOutlier <- if_else(item_scores_df$Mahal > (median(item_scores_df$Mahal) + (3*sd(item_scores_df$Mahal))), TRUE, FALSE)

library(dplyr)
OutlierCount <- item_scores_df%>%
  count(MOutlier)
OutlierCount

NumOutliers <- nrow(item_scores_df) - OutlierCount #calculating how many outliers
NumOutliers #this object is used for the inline text for the reesults
NumOutliers

head(item_scores_df) #shows us the first 6 rows of the data so we can see the new variables (Mahal, MOutlier)

```

CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR THE APA STYLE WRITE-UP:  We evaluated multivariate normality with the Mahalanobis distance test. Specifically, we used the *outlier()* function in the *psych* package and included all continuous variables in the calculation. Our visual inspection of the Q-Q plot suggested that the plotted line strayed from the straight line as the quantiles increased.  Additionally, we appended the Mahalanobis distance scores as a variable to the data. Analyzing this variable, we found that `r NumOutliers$n` exceed three standard deviations beyond the median. *Thus, with no outliers, we assumed multivariate normality and proceeded with the data analysis* AS DATA IS ADDED THIS NUMBER OF OUTLIERS COULD UPDATE FROM ZERO AND THIS TEXT COULD CHANGE.

## A Few Words on Transformations

To quote from Kline [-@kline_principles_2016], "Before applying a normalizing transformation, you should think about the variables of interest and whether the expectation of normality is reasonable." (p. 77)  

At this point in history, the non-normal distribution of the proportions of classmates who are Black and instructional staff who are BIPOC are accurate representations in higher education. Kline [-@kline_principles_2016] has noted that transforming an inherently non-normal variable to force a normal distribution may fundamentally alter it such that the variable of interest is not actually studied. Kline's chapter reviews some options for applying corrections to outliers.  Additionally, the chapter describes a variety of normalizing transformations.

On a personal note, while I will use stadardized scores (a linear transformation) if it improves interpretation and center variables around a meaningful intercept, I tend to resist the transformation of data without a really compelling reason. Why?  It's complicated and can make interpretation difficult.


## The APA Style Write-Up

Since the focus of this chapter was on data diagnostics, the APA style writeup will focus on on this element of the Method section:

### Data Diagnostics

Data screening suggested that `r attempts` individuals opened the survey link. Of those, `r consented_attempts` granted consent and proceeded to the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; `r US_inclusion` met this criteria.

Available item analysis (AIA; [@parent_handling_2013]) is a strategy for managing missing data that uses available data for analysis and excludes cases with missing data points only for analyses in which the data points would be directly involved. Parent (2013) suggested that AIA is equivalent to more complex methods (e.g., multiple imputation) across a number of variations of sample size, magnitude of associations among items, and degree of missingness. Thus, we utilized Parent’s recommendations to guide our approach to managing missing data. Missing data analyses were conducted with tools in base R as well as the R packages, *psych* (v. 1.0.12) and *mice* (v. 3.13.0). 

Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from `r missMin`% to `r missMax`%.  Across the dataset, `r CellsMiss` of cells had missing data and `r CaseComplete` of cases had nonmissing data. At this stage in the analysis, we allowed all cases with less than 90% missing to continue to the scoring stage. Guided by Parent's [-@parent_handling_2013] AIA approach, scales with three items were scored if at least two items were non-missing; the scale with four items was scored if it at least three non-missing items; and the scale with six items was scored if it had at least five non-missing items. 

Across the `r ScoredCaseMiss` cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from `r ScrdMissMin`% to `r ScrdMissMax`%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20% missing, the dataset analyzed included `r ScoredCasesIncluded` cases. In this dataset we had `r PrScoredCellsMissing` missing across the df; `r PrScoredRowsMissing` of the rows had nonmissing data.

Regarding the distributional characteristics of the data, skew and kurtosis values of the variables fell below the values of 3 (skew) and 8 to 20 (kurtosis) that Kline suggests are concerning [-@kline_principles_2016]. Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicate that our variables assessing the proportion of classmates who are Black ($W$ = `r cmSW`, $p$ = `r cmSWp`) and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff($W$ = `r iSW`, $p$ = `r iSWp`)  are statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. The scales assessing the respondent's belonging ($W$ = `r belSW`, $p$ = `r belSWp`) and the respondent's perception of campus climate for Black students ($W$ = `r clSW`, $p$ = `r clSWp`) did not differ differently from a normal distribution.

We evaluated multivariate normality with the Mahalanobis distance test. Specifically, we used the *outlier()* function in the *psych* package and included all continuous variables in the calculation. Our visual inspection of the Q-Q plot suggested that the plotted line strayed from the straight line as the quantiles increased.  Additionally, we appended the Mahalanobis distance scores as a variable to the data. Analyzing this variable, we found that `r NumOutliers$n` exceed three standard deviations beyond the median. *Thus, with no outliers, we assumed multivariate normality and proceeded with the data analysis* AS DATA IS ADDED THIS NUMBER OF OUTLIERS COULD UPDATE FROM ZERO AND THIS TEXT COULD CHANGE.

Given that our sample sizes were reasonable for the planned analyses and the degree of missingness was low, we used pairwise deletion in our multiple regression analysis.

## A Quick Regression of our Research Vignette

With some confidence that our scrubbed-and-scored variables are appropriate for analysis, let me conduct the super quick regression that is our research vignette.

![An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data.](images/Ch04/BlStuRegression.jpg)

```{r Predicting perceptions of campus climate for Black students}
Climate_fit <- lm(ClimateBL ~ Belonging + cmBlack + iBIPOC_pr, data = item_scores_df)
summary(Climate_fit)
```

```{r Coefficients and p values for inline text, echo = FALSE, results ='hide'}
library(formattable)
#Here I am creating objects to feed into the inline text as I write up the results
Bel_B <- digits(Climate_fit$coefficients[2],3) #this is the beta weight for Belonging
Bel_p <- digits(summary(Climate_fit)$coefficients[2,4],3) #this is the p value for Belonging
Bel_B #listing the object lets me check to see that I obtained the correct value
Bel_p

cm_B <- digits(Climate_fit$coefficients[3],3) #beta weight for proportion of classmates who are Black
cm_p <- digits(summary(Climate_fit)$coefficients[3,4],3)#p value for proportion of classmates who are Black
cm_B
cm_p

i_B <- digits(Climate_fit$coefficients[4],3) #beta weight for proportion of instructional staff who are Black
i_p <- digits(summary(Climate_fit)$coefficients[4,4],3) #p value for for proportion of instructional staff who are Black
i_B
i_p

modR2 <- percent(summary(Climate_fit)$r.squared)
modR2

#this section doesn't appear in the built/knitted products because I used "echo=False, results='hide'" in the chunk label
```

```{r}
names(Climate_fit)
```


Results of a multiple regression predicting the respondents' perceptions of campus climate for Black students indicated that neither contributions of the respondents' personal belonging ($B$ = `r Bel_B`, $p$ = `r Bel_p`) nor the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff ($B$ = `r i_B`, $p$ = `r i_p`), nor the proportion of Black classmates ($B$ = `r cm_B`, $p$ = `r cm_p`) led to statistically significant changes in perceptions of campus climate for Black students.  Although it accounted for `r modR2` of the variance, the overall model was not statistically significant. Results are presented in Table 2.

```{r}
library(apaTables)
apa.cor.table(item_scores_df[c("iBIPOC_pr", "cmBlack", "Belonging", "ClimateBL")], table.number = 1, show.sig.stars = TRUE, filename = "Table1_M_SDs_r_DataDx.doc")
```

```{r}
library(apaTables)
apaTables::apa.reg.table(Climate_fit, table.number = 2, filename = "Climate_table.doc")
```

## Practice Problems

The three problems described below are designed to be continuations from the previous chapter (Scrubbing). You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis.

### Problem #3:  Other data

If you chose this option in the prior chapter, you used raw data that was available to you. You imported it into R, applied inclusion/exclusion criteria, renamed variables, downsized the df to the variables of interest, properly formatted the variables, interpreted item-level missingness, scored the scales/subscales, interpreted scale-level missingness, and wrote up the results.

Continue working with this data to:

# Multiple Imputation (A Brief Demo) {#multimp}

 [Screencasted Lecture Link] <!-- TODO: Add link to screencast. -->

Multiple imputation is a tool for managing missing data that works with the whole raw data file to impute values for missing data for *multiple sets* (e.g., 5-20) of the raw data. Those multiple sets are considered together in analyses (such as regression) and interpretation is made on the pooled results.  Much has been written about multiple imputation and, if used, should be done with many considerations.  This chapter is intended as a brief introduction.  In this chapter, I demonstrate the use of multiple imputation with the data from the [Rate-a-Recent-Course:  A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise](https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU) that has served as the research vignette for the first few chapters of this OER.

## Navigating this Lesson

<!-- TODO: Update how long it will take. -->
There is about # hours and ## minutes of lecture.  If you work through the materials with me it would be good to add another ## hours.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail.  All original materials are provided at the [Github site](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivariateModeling) that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's [introduction](#ReCintro)

### Learning Objectives

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

* Describe circumstances under which multiple imputation would be appropriate* 
* List and define the stages in multiple imputation.
* Apply multiple imputation to a dataset that has missingness
* Interpret results from a simple regression that uses multiple imputation
* Articulate how multiple imputation fits into the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.
* Write up the results of an the process of imputation from raw data through analyzing a simple regression (or similar) analysis.

### Planning for Practice

<!-- TODO: Specify set of items to score for homework. -->

The suggestions from practice are a continuation from the three prior chapters. If you have completed one or more of those assignments, you should have worked through the steps in preparing a data set and evaluating its appropriateness for the planned, statistical, analysis. This chapter takes a deviation from the AIA [@parent_handling_2013] approach that was the focus of the first few chapters in that we used multiple imputation as the approach for managing missingness.  Options, of graded complexity, for practice include:

* Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written.
* Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose.
* Begin with raw data to which you have access.

## Workflow for Multiple Imputation

The following is a proposed workflow for preparing data for analysis. 

<!-- TODO: When finalized, save as PDF so it can open in its own window) -->

![An image of a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data.](images/Ch05/scrubscore_mimp_itemlvl.jpg) 

In this lecture we are working on the right side of the flowchart in the multiple imputation (blue) section.  Within it, there are two options, each with a slightly different set of options.

* imputing at the item level
  * in this case, scales/subscales are scored after the item-level imputation
* imputating at the scale level
  * in this case, scales/subscales are scored prior to the imputation; likely using some of the same criteria as identified in the scoring chapter (i.e., scoring if 75-80% of data are non-missing). Multiple imputation, then, is used to estimate the remaining, missing values.
 
Whichever approach is used, the imputed variables (multiple sets) are used in a *pooled analysis* and results are interpreted from that analysis.

## Research Vignette

The research vignette comes from the survey titled, [Rate-a-Recent-Course:  A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise](https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU) and is explained in the [scrubbing chapter](#scrub). In the [scoring chapter](#score) we prepared four variables for analysis. In the [data diagnostics chapter](#DataDx) we assessed the quality of the variables and conducted the multiple regression described below. Details for these are in our [codebook](./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf).

Variable recap:

* Perceived Campus Climate for Black Students includes 6 items, one of which was reverse scored. This scale was adapted from Szymanski et al.'s [-@szymanski_perceptions_2020] Campus Climate for LGBTQ students. It has not been evaluated for use with other groups.  The Szymanski et al. analysis suggested that it could be used as a total scale score, or divided into three items each that assess
  * College response to LGBTQ students (items 6, 4, 1)
  * LGBTQ stigma (items 3, 2, 5)
* Sense of Belonging includes 3 items. This is a subscale from Bollen and Hoyle's [-@bollen_perceived_1990] Perceived Cohesion Scale. There are no items on this scale that require reversing.
* Percent of Black classmates is a single item that asked respondents to estimate the proportion of students in various racial categories
* Percent of BIPOC instructional staff, similarly, asked respondents to identify the racial category of each member of their instructional staff

As we noted in the [scrubbing chapter](#scrub), our design has notable limitations. Briefly, (a) owing to the open source aspect of the data we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent; (b) the items that ask respondents to *guess* the identities of the instructional staff and to place them in broad categories, (c) we do not provide a "write-in" a response. We made these decisions after extensive conversation with stakeholders. The primary reason for these decisions was to prevent potential harm (a) to respondents who could be identified if/when the revealed private information in this open-source survey, and (b) trolls who would write inappropriate or harmful comments. 
  
As I think about "how these variables go together" (which is often where I start in planning a study), imagine a parallel mediation.  That is the perception of campus climate for Black students would be predicted by the respondent's sense of belonging, mediated in separate paths through the proportion of classmates who are Black and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff.  

*I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the %Black instructional staff.  At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this.* 

![An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data.](images/Ch04/BlStuMed.jpg)

As in the [data diagnostic chapter](#DataDx), I will conclude this chapter by conducting a statistical analysis with the multiply imputed data. Because parallel mediation can be complicated (I teach it in a later chapter), I will demonstrate use of our prepared variables with a simple multiple regression.

## Multiple Imputation -- a Super Brief Review

Multiple imputation is complex. Numerous quantitative psychologists had critiqued it and provided numerous cautions and guidelines for its use [@enders_applied_2010; @enders_multiple_2017; @little_missing_2008; @little_statistical_2002]. In brief, 

### Steps in Multiple Imputation

* Multiple imputation starts with a raw data file. 
  * Multiple imputation assumes that data are MAR (remember, MCAR is the more prestigiouos one).  This means that researchers assume that missing values can be replaced by predictions derived from the observable portion of the dataset.  
* Multiple datsets (often 5 to 20) are created where missing values are replaced via a randomized process (so the same missing value [item 4 for person A] will likely have different values for each dataset). 
* The desired anlayis(es) is conducted simultaneously/separately for each of the imputed sets (so if you imputed 5 sets and wanted a linear regression, you get 5 linear regressions).  
* A *pooled analysis* uses the point estimates and the standard errors to provide a single result that represents the analysis.

In a web-hosted guide from the University of Virginia Library, Katitas [-@katitas_getting_2019] provided a user-friendly review and example of using tools in R in a multiple imputation. Katitas' figure is a useful conceptual tool in understanding how multiple imputation works. *This figure is my recreation of Katitas' original.*

![An image adapted from the Katitas multiple imputation guide showing the four stages of multiple imputation.](images/Ch05/KatitasMimpFig.jpg)

* the datframe with missing data is the single place we start
* we intervene with a package like *mice()* to impute
* multiple sets of data (filling in the missing variables with different values that are a product of their conditional distribution and an element of "random"); 
  * "mids" ("multiply imputed dataset") is an object class where the completed datasets are stored.
* the "with_mids" command allows OLS regression to be run, as many times as we have imputed datasets (in this figure, 3X).  It produces different regression coefficients for each datset
* the "pool" command pools together the multiple coefficients taking into consideration the value of the coefficients,the standard errors, and the variance of the missing value parmeter across the samples.

### Statistical Approaches to Multiple Imputation

**Joint multivariate normal distribution multiple imputation** assumes that the observed data follow a multivariate normal distribution.  The algorithm used draws from this assumed distribution.  A drawback is that if the data do not follow a multivariate normal distribution, the imputed values are incorrect.  *Amelia* and *norm* packages use this approach.

**Conditional multiple imputation** is an iterative procedure, modeling the conditional distribution of a certain variable given the other variables.  In this way the distribution is assumed for each variable, rather than or the entire dataset.  *mice* uses this approach.

*mice*:  multivariate imputation by chained equations

## Working the Problem

Katitas [@katitas_getting_2019] claims that it is best to impute the data in its rawest form possible because any change would be taking it away from its original distribution.  There are debates about how many variables to include in an imputation.  Some authors would suggest that researchers include everything that was collected. Others (like me) will slim down the dataset to include (a) the variables included in the model, plus (b) auxilliary variables (i.e., variables not in the model, but that are sufficiently non-missing and will provide additional information to the data).

In our case we will want:

Item for the variables represented in our model

* the item level responses to the scales/subscales
  * respondents' sense of belonging to campus (3 items)
  * respondents' rating of campus climate for Black students (6 items)
* proportion of BIPOC instructional staff
* proportion of classmates who are Black

Auxilliary variables -- let's choose three.  I'm choosing items from the course evaluation that sample a traditional item, a item about inclusivity/diversity, and an item about the student's growth

* format, whether the course was taught in-person, a blend, or virtual
* cEval_1, "Course material was presented clearly"
* cEval_13, "Where applicable, issues were considered from multiple perspectives"
* cEval_19, "My understanding of the subject matter increased over the span of the course"


### Selecting and Formatting Variables

There are some guidelines for selecting and formatting variables for imputation.  

* Variables should be in their "naturalist" state
* Redundant or too highly correlated variables should not be included
  * If you reverse coded a variable (we haven't yet), that's ok, but EXCLUDE the original variable
  * Redundant variables (or multicollinear variables) may cause the multiple imputation process to cease
  * Violation of this also provides clues for troubleshooting
* Exclude variables with more than 25% missing

To make this as realistic as possible. let's start with our very raw data.  The [Scrubbing chapter](#scrub) provides greater detail on importing data directly from Qualtrics.  Therefore, I will repeat our protocol that imports the data and then scrubs it for our purposes. As described in the prior chapter, I named variables in Qualtrics to facilitate a more intuitive use in R.

```{r intRavenous qualtRics, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(qualtRics)
QTRX_df2 <- qualtRics::fetch_survey(surveyID = "SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU",useLocalTime = TRUE,
                         verbose = FALSE, label=FALSE, convert=FALSE, force_request = TRUE, import_id = FALSE)
```

Next, I apply inclusion/exclusion criteria.  As described in the [Scrubbing chapter](#scrub) this includes:

* excluding all *previews*
* including only those who consented
* including only those whose rated course was offered by a U.S. institution

```{r Apply inclusion and exclusion critera}
library(tidyverse)
QTRX_df2 <- filter (QTRX_df2, DistributionChannel != "preview")
QTRX_df2 <-filter (QTRX_df2, Consent == 1)
QTRX_df2 <-filter (QTRX_df2, USinst == 0)
```

Preparing the data also meant renaming some variables that started with numbers (a hassle in R). I also renamed variables on the Campus Climate scale so that we know to which subscale they belong.
```{r rename variables that start with a number}
library(tidyverse)
#renaming variables that started with numbers
QTRX_df2 <- rename(QTRX_df2, iRace1 = '1_iRace', iRace2 = '2_iRace', iRace3 = '3_iRace', iRace4 = '4_iRace', iRace5 = '5_iRace', iRace6 = '6_iRace', iRace7 = '7_iRace', iRace8 = '8_iRace', iRace9 = '9_iRace', iRace10 = '10_iRace')
#renaming variables from the identification of classmates
QTRX_df2 <- rename(QTRX_df2, cmBiMulti = Race_10, cmBlack = Race_1, cmNBPoC = Race_7, cmWhite = Race_8, cmUnsure = Race_2)
```

The Qualtrics download does not include an ID number.  Because new variables are always appended to the end of the df, we also include code to make this the first column. 
```{r applying an ID number for each case}
QTRX_df2 <- QTRX_df2 %>% mutate(ID = row_number())
#moving the ID number to the first column; requires 
QTRX_df2 <- QTRX_df2%>%select(ID, everything())
```

Because this huge df is cumbersome to work with, let's downsize it to be closer to the size we will work with in the imputation

```{r downsizing the df}
mimp_df <-  select (QTRX_df2, ID, iRace1, iRace2, iRace3, iRace4, iRace5, iRace6, iRace7, iRace8, iRace9, iRace10, cmBiMulti, cmBlack, cmNBPoC, cmWhite, cmUnsure, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6, cEval_1, cEval_13, cEval_19, format)
glimpse(mimp_df)
```

Qualtrics imports many of the categorical variables as numbers.  R often reads them numerically (integers or numbers). If they are directly converted to factors, R will sometimes collapse.  In this example, if there is a race that is not represented (e.g., 2 for BiMulti), when the numbers are changed to factors, R will assume it's ordered and will change up the numbers.  Therefore, it is ESSENTIAL to check (again and again ad nauseum) to ensure that your variables are recoding in a manner you understand.

```{r creating an ordered factor}
mimp_df$iRace1 = factor(mimp_df$iRace1,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
mimp_df$iRace2 = factor(mimp_df$iRace2,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
mimp_df$iRace3 = factor(mimp_df$iRace3,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
mimp_df$iRace4 = factor(mimp_df$iRace4,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
mimp_df$iRace5 = factor(mimp_df$iRace5,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
mimp_df$iRace6 = factor(mimp_df$iRace6,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
mimp_df$iRace7 = factor(mimp_df$iRace7,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
mimp_df$iRace8 = factor(mimp_df$iRace8,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
mimp_df$iRace9 = factor(mimp_df$iRace9,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
mimp_df$iRace10 = factor(mimp_df$iRace10,
                        levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                        labels = c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti", "White", "NotNotice"))
```

```{r another peek, results='hide'}
glimpse(mimp_df)
```


```{r calculating the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff}
#creating a count of BIPOC faculty identified by each respondent
mimp_df$count.BIPOC <- apply(mimp_df[c("iRace1", "iRace2", "iRace3", "iRace4", "iRace5", "iRace6", "iRace7", "iRace8", "iRace9", "iRace10")], 1, function(x) sum(x %in% c("Black", "nBpoc", "BiMulti")))

#creating a count of all instructional  faculty identified by each respondent
mimp_df$count.nMiss <- apply(mimp_df[c("iRace1", "iRace2", "iRace3", "iRace4", "iRace5", "iRace6", "iRace7", "iRace8", "iRace9", "iRace10")], 1, function(x) sum(!is.na(x)))

#calculating the proportion of BIPOC faculty with the counts above
mimp_df$iBIPOC_pr = mimp_df$count.BIPOC/mimp_df$count.nMiss
```

I have included another variable, *format* that we will use as auxiliary variable. As written, these are the following meanings:

1. In-person (all persons are attending in person)
2. In person (some students are attending remotely)
3. Blended:  some sessions in person and some sessions online/virtual
4. Online or virtual
5. Other

Let's recoded it to have three categories:

0. 100% in-person (1)
1. Some sort of blend/mix (2, 3)
2. 100% online/virtual (4)
NA. Other (5)

```{r creating an ordered factor for course format}
#we can assign more than one value to the same factor by repeating the label
mimp_df$format = factor(mimp_df$format,
                        levels = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                        labels = c("InPerson", "Blend", "Blend", "Online", is.na(5)))
```


Let's trim the df again to just include the variables we need in the imputation.
```{r trim the df to variables of interest}
mimp_df <-  select (mimp_df, ID, iBIPOC_pr, cmBlack, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6, cEval_1, cEval_13, cEval_19, format)
```

Recall one of the guidelines was to remove variables with more than 25% missing. This code calculates the proportion missing from our variables and places them in rank order.
```{r Proportion of missingness of each variable for raw data}
p_missing <- unlist(lapply(mimp_df, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))/nrow(mimp_df)
sort(p_missing[p_missing > 0], decreasing = TRUE)
```
Luckily, none of our variables have more than 25% missing (*or at least they didn't when I wrote this; the open nature of the survey and how it sources this chapter could change this*). If we did have a variable with more than 25% missing, we would have to consider what to do about it.

Later we learn that we should eliminate case with greater than 50% missingness.  Let's write code for that, now.

```{r Remove cases with too much missingness}
#Calculating number and proportion of item-level missingness
mimp_df$nmiss <- mimp_df%>%
    select(iBIPOC_pr:format) %>% #the colon allows us to include all variables between the two listed (the variables need to be in order)
    is.na %>% 
    rowSums

mimp_df<- mimp_df%>%
  mutate(prop_miss = (nmiss/15)*100) #11 is the number of variables included in calculating the proportion

mimp_df <- filter(mimp_df, prop_miss <= 50)  #update df to have only those with at least 90% of complete data
```

Once again, trim the df to include on the data to be included in the imputation
```{r another trimming of the df}
mimp_df <-  select (mimp_df, ID, iBIPOC_pr, cmBlack, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6, cEval_1, cEval_13, cEval_19, format)
```

### The Multiple Imputation

Because multiple imputation is a *random* process, if we all want the same answers we need to set a *random seed.* 

```{r Set random seed}
set.seed(210324) #you can pick any number you want, today I'm using today's datestamp
```

The program we will use is *mice*. *mice* assumes that each variable has a distribution and it imputes missing variables according to that distribution.  
This means we need to correctly specify each variable's format/role.  *mice* will automatically choose a distribution (think "format") for each variable; we can override this by changing the methods' characteristics.

The following code sets up the structure for the imputation. I'm not an expert at this -- just following the Katitas example.

```{r Setting up the structure for the imputation}
library(mice)
# runs the mice code with 0 iterations
imp <- mice(mimp_df, maxit = 0)
# Extract predictorMatrix and methods of imputation 
predM = imp$predictorMatrix
meth = imp$method
```

Here we code what format/role each variable should be.
```{r Specifying variable role in imputation}
#These variables are left in the dataset, but setting them = 0 means they are not used as predictors.  
#We want our ID to be retained in the df.  There's nothing missing from it, and we don't want it used as a predictor, so it will just hang out.
predM[, c("ID")]=0

#If you like, view the first few rows of the predictor matrix
#head(predM)

#We don't have any ordered categorical variables, but if we did we would follow this format
#poly <- c("Var1", "Var2")

#We don't have any dichotomous variables, but if we did we would follow this format
#log <- c("Var3", "Var4")

#Uunordered categorical variables (nominal variables), but if we did we would follow this format
poly2 <- c("format")

#Turn their methods matrix into the specified imputation models
#Remove the hashtag if you have any of these variables
#meth[poly] = "polr" 
#meth[log] = "logreg"
meth[poly2] = "polyreg"

meth
```

This list (meth) contains all our variables; "pmm" is the default and is the "predictive mean matching" process used. We see tht format (an unordered categorical variable) is noted as "polyreg."  If we had used other categorical variables (ordered/poly, dichotomous/log), we would have seen those designations, instead.  If there is "" underneath it means the data is complete.

Our variables of interest are now configured to be imputed with the imputation method we specified.  Empty cells in the method matrix mean that those variables aren't going to be imputed.

If a variable has no missing values, it is automatically set to be empty.  We can also manually set variables to not be imputed with the *meth[variable]=""* command.

The code below begins the imputation process. We are asking for 5 datasets. If you have many cases and many variables, this can take awhile. How many imputations?  Recommendations have ranged as low as five to several hundred.


```{r imputing five sets}
# With this command, we tell mice to impute the anesimpor2 data, create 5vvdatasets, use predM as the predictor matrix and don't print the imputation process. 
#If you would like to see the process (or if the process is failing to execute) set print as TRUE; seeing where the execution halts can point to problematic variables (more notes at end of lecture)

imp2 <- mice(mimp_df, maxit = 5, 
             predictorMatrix = predM, 
             method = meth, print =  FALSE)
```

We need to create a "long file" that stacks all the imputed data.  Looking at the df in R Studio shows us that when imp = 0 (the pe-imputed data), there is still missingness.  As we scroll through the remaining imputations, there are no NA cells.

```{r Restructuring df to long}
# First, turn the datasets into long format
# This procedure is, best I can tell, unique to mice and wouldn't work for repeated measures designs
mimp_long <- mice::complete(imp2, action="long", include = TRUE)
```

If we look at it, we can see 6 sets of data.  Playing with it...

* .imp = 0 is the unimputed set; there are still missing values
* .imp = 1, 2, 3, or 5 has no missing values for the variables we included in the imputation

Sort on the ID number to see how this works...6 sets of data.

With this fully imputed file, let's recode the data as we had done for the OLS regression with the raw, unimputed, data.

```{r Proportion of missingness for each imputed item, eval = FALSE}
p_missing_mimp_long <- unlist(lapply(mimp_long, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))/nrow(mimp_long)
sort(p_missing_mimp_long[p_missing_mimp_long > 0], decreasing = TRUE)#check to see if this works
```

### Creating Scale Scores

Because our imputation was item-level, we need to score the variables with scales/subscales.  As demonstrated more completely in the [Scoring chapter](#score), this required reversing one item in the campus climate scale:

```{r reverse scoring the Blst_1 item}
mimp_long<- mimp_long %>%
  mutate(rBlst_1 = 8 - Blst_1) #if you had multiple items, you could add a pipe (%>%) at the end of the line and add more until the last one
```


Below is the scoring protocol we used in the AIA protocol for scoring.  Although the protocol below functionally says, "Create a mean score if (65-80)% is non-missing, for the imputed version, it doesn't harm anything to leave this because there is no missing data.
```{r Scoring scales and subscales}
library(sjstats)
#Making the list of variables
Belonging_vars <- c('Belong_1','Belong_2','Belong_3')
ResponseBL_vars <- c('rBlst_1', 'Blst_4','Blst_6')
StigmaBL_vars <- c('Blst_2', 'Blst_3','Blst_5')
ClimateBL_vars <- c('rBlst_1', 'Blst_4','Blst_6','Blst_2', 'Blst_3','Blst_5' )

#Creating the new variables
mimp_long$Belonging <- mean_n(mimp_long[,Belonging_vars], .65)
mimp_long$ResponseBL <- mean_n(mimp_long[,ResponseBL_vars], .80)
mimp_long$StigmaBL <- mean_n(mimp_long[,StigmaBL_vars], .80)
mimp_long$ClimateBL <- mean_n(mimp_long[,ClimateBL_vars], .80)
```


## Multiple Regression with Multiply Imputed Data

For a refresher, here was the script when we used the AIA approach for managing missingness:

~~~
Climate_fit <- lm(ClimateBL ~ Belonging + cmBlack + iBIPOC_pr, data = item_scores_df)
summary(Climate_fit)
~~~

In order for the regression to use multiply imputed data, it must be a "mids" (multiply imputed data sets) type
```{r Convertion to mids_A}
# Convert to mids type - mice can work with this type
mimp_mids<-as.mids(mimp_long)
```

Here's what we do with imputed data:

```{r OLS regression w imputed data}
fitimp <- with(mimp_mids,
               lm(ClimateBL ~ Belonging + cmBlack + iBIPOC_pr))
```

In this process, 5 individual, OLS, regressions are being conducted and the results being pooled into this single set.

```{r Summary of each OLS regression}
# to get the 5, individual imputations
summary(fitimp)
```

```{r The pooled result}
# the pooled result
pooledests <- pool(fitimp)
pooledests
#str(pooledests)
```

```{r Another view of the pooled result}
sumpooled <- summary(pool(fitimp))
sumpooled
#str(sumpooled)
```

```{r creating the inline text objects, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(formattable)
mimpBel_B <- digits(sumpooled$estimate[2],3)
mimpBel_B
mimpBel_p <- digits(sumpooled$p.value[2],3)
mimpBel_p
mimp_cmBl_B <- digits(sumpooled$estimate[3],3)
mimp_cmBl_B
mimp_cmBl_p <- digits(sumpooled$p.value[3],3)
mimp_cmBl_p
mimp_i_B <- digits(sumpooled$estimate[4],3)
mimp_i_B
mimp_i_p <- digits(sumpooled$p.value[4],3)
mimp_i_p
```
Results of a multiple regression predicting the respondents' perceptions of campus climate for Black students indicated that neither contributions of the respondents' personal belonging ($B$ = `r mimpBel_B`, $p$ = `r mimpBel_p`) nor the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff ($B$ = `r mimp_i_B`, $p$ = `r mimp_i_p`) led to statistically significant changes in perceptions of campus climate for Black students. Results did suggest a statistically significant negative effect of the proportion of Black classmates on the campus climate for Black students. Specifically, as the proportion of Black students increases, there is less stigmatization and hostility on the campus ($B$ = `r mimp_cmBl_B`, $p$ = `r mimp_cmBl_p`). Results are presented in Table X.


## Toward the APA Style Write-up

### Method/Data Diagnostics

Data screening suggested that `r attempts` individuals opend the survey link. Of those, `r consented_attempts` granted consent and proceeded to the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; `r US_inclusion` met this criteria.  Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from `r missMin`% to `r missMax`%.  Across the dataset, `r CellsMiss` of cells had missing data and `r CaseComplete` of cases had nonmissing data. At this stage in the analysis, we allowed all cases with fewer than 50% missing to be included the multiple imputation [@katitas_getting_2019].

Regarding the distributional characteristics of the data, skew and kurtosis values of the variables fell below the values of 3 (skew) and 8 to 20 (kurtosis) that Kline suggests are concerning [-@kline_principles_2016]. Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicate that our variables assessing the proportion of classmates who are Black ($W$ = `r cmSW`, $p$ = `r cmSWp`) and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff($W$ = `r iSW`, $p$ = `r iSWp`)  are statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. The scales assessing the respondent's belonging ($W$ = `r belSW`, $p$ = `r belSWp`) and the respondent's perception of campus climate for Black students ($W$ = `r clSW`, $p$ = `r clSWp`) did not differ differently from a normal distribution.

We evaluated multivariate normality with the Mahalanobis distance test. Specifically, we used the *outlier()* function in the *psych* package and included all continuous variables in the calculation. Our visual inspection of the Q-Q plot suggested that the plotted line strayed from the straight line as the quantiles increased.  Additionally, we appended the Mahalanobis distance scores as a variable to the data. Analyzing this variable, we found that `r NumOutliers$n` exceed three standard deviations beyond the median. *Thus, with no outliers, we assumed multivariate normality and proceeded with the data analysis* AS DATA IS ADDED THIS NUMBER OF OUTLIERS COULD UPDATE FROM ZERO AND THIS TEXT COULD CHANGE.*

We managed missing data with multiple imputation [@enders_multiple_2017; @katitas_getting_2019]. We imputed five sets of data with the R package, *mice* (v. 3.13) -- a program that utilizes conditional multiple imputation. The imputation included the item-level variables that comprised our scales, the variables that represented proportion of BIPOC instructional staff and proportion of Black classmates, as well as four auxiliary variables (three variables from the course evaluation and the format [in-person/blended/virtual] of the class).

### Results

Results of a multiple regression predicting the respondents' perceptions of campus climate for Black students indicated that neither contributions of the respondents' personal belonging ($B$ = `r Bel_B`, $p$ = `r Bel_p`) nor the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff ($B$ = `r i_B`, $p$ = `r i_p`) led to statistically significant changes in perceptions of campus climate for Black students. Results did suggest a statistically significant negative effect of the proportion of Black classmates on the campus climate for Black students. Specifically, as the proportion of Black students increases, there is less stigmatization and hostility on the campus ($B$ = `r cm_B`, $p$ = `r cm_p`). Although it accounted for `r modR2` of the variance, the overall model was not statistically significant. Results are presented in Table 2.

**Some notes about this write-up**

* I went ahead and used the data diagnostics that we did in the AIA method.  It feels to me like these should be calculated with the multiply imputed data (i.e., 5 sets, with pooled estimates and standard errors), but I do not see that modeled -- anywhere in R.
* Note the similarities with the AIA write-up. 


## Multiple imputation considerations

1. Character vectors (i.e., values that are represented with words) can be problematic.  If they are causing trouble, consider
   * recode into factors,
   * keep it in the df, but exclude it from the imputation protocol,
   * our "format" variable was an ordered factor (i.e., each term was associated with a value), so I think that helped us avoid problems
   
2. Variables with really high (like 50% or more) proportions of missingness should be excluded.

3. Variables that are highly correlated or redundant (even if inverse) will halt the execution. If you set print=TRUE you will see where the algorithm is having difficulty because it will halt at that variable.

4. Variables with non-missing values can be problematic.  If they are problematic, just exclude them from the process.

5. Width (columns/variables) versus length (rows/cases).  You must have more columns/variables than rows/cases.  It is difficult to say how many.  If this is a problem:
  * Consider scoring scales first with AIA, then impute with whole scales.
  * Divide the df in halves or thirds, impute separately, then join with the ID numbers. 
  * There should be auxiliary variables in each.

6. Item-level imputation is its "whole big thing" with multiple, complex considerations.  There are tremendous resources
  *  Enders [BLIMP](http://www.appliedmissingdata.com/multilevel-imputation.html) app is free and works with R
  *  Little's [-@little_statistical_2002] article

7. How many imputations? Controversial and has changed over the years. 
  *  Practical concern: the more you request, the longer it will take in R, this demo was 5
  *  For a number of years there was a push for 20, but I've also seen recommendations for 100s.
  *  Check examples of imputed studies in your disciplinary specialty/journals.

7. There are lots of discussions and debates about
   * allowing for fractional/decimal responses (a 3.5 on 1 to 4 scaling; or a 0.75 on a dichotomous variable such as male/female)
   * out-of-bounds estimates (what if you get a 7 on 1 to 4 scaling?)

It can be helpful to save outfiles of progress as we go along.  Here I save this raw file.

## Practice Problems

The three problems described below are designed to be continuations from the previous chapters. You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis.

### Problem #2:  Use the *Rate-a-Recent-Course* Survey, Choosing Different Variables

If you chose this option in the prior chapter, you chose a minimum of three variables from the *Rate-a-Recent-Course* survey to include in a simple statistical model. You imported the data from Qualtrics, applied inclusion/exclusion criteria, renamed variables, downsized the df to the variables of interest, properly formatted the variables, interpreted item-level missingness, scored the scales/subscales, interpreted scale-level missingness, and wrote up the results.

### Problem #3:  Other data

If you chose this option in the prior chapter, you used raw data that was available to you. You imported it into R, applied inclusion/exclusion criteria, renamed variables, downsized the df to the variables of interest, properly formatted the variables, interpreted item-level missingness, scored the scales/subscales, interpreted scale-level missingness, and wrote up the results.
